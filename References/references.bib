	abstract = {Pangenomes offer detailed characterizations of core and accessory genes found in a set of closely related microbial genomes, generally by clustering genes based on sequence homology. In comparison, metagenomes facilitate highly resolved investigations of the relative distribution of microbial genomes and individual genes across environments through read recruitment analyses. Combining these complementary approaches can yield unique insights into the functional basis of microbial niche partitioning and fitness, however, advanced software solutions are lacking. Here we present an integrated analysis and visualization strategy that provides an interactive and reproducible framework to generate pangenomes and to study them in conjunction with metagenomes. To investigate its utility, we applied this strategy to a Prochlorococcus pangenome in the context of a large-scale marine metagenomic survey. The resulting Prochlorococcus metapangenome revealed remarkable differential abundance patterns between very closely related isolates that belonged to the same phylogenetic cluster and that differed by only a small number of gene clusters in the pangenome. While the relationships between these genomes based on gene clusters correlated with their environmental distribution patterns, phylogenetic analyses using marker genes or concatenated single-copy core genes did not recapitulate these patterns. The metapangenome also revealed a small set of core genes that mostly occurred in hypervariable genomic islands of the Prochlorococcus populations, which systematically lacked read recruitment from surface ocean metagenomes. Notably, these core gene clusters were all linked to sugar metabolism, suggesting potential benefits to Prochlorococcus from a high sequence diversity of sugar metabolism genes. The rapidly growing number of microbial genomes and increasing availability of environmental metagenomes provide new opportunities to investigate the functioning and the ecology of microbial populations, and metapangenomes can provide unique insights for any taxon and biome for which genomic and sufficiently deep metagenomic data are available.},

	abstract = {Bacterial plant pathogens of the Pectobacterium genus are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases in plants, including important crops such as potato, tomato, lettuce, and banana. Investigation of the genetic diversity underlying virulence and host specificity can be performed at genome level by using a comprehensive comparative approach called pangenomics. A pangenomic approach, using newly developed functionalities in PanTools, was applied to analyze the complex phylogeny of the Pectobacterium genus. We specifically used the pangenome to investigate genetic differences between virulent and avirulent strains of P. brasiliense, a potato blackleg causing species dominantly present in Western Europe. Here we generated a multilevel pangenome for Pectobacterium, comprising 197 strains across 19 species, including type strains, with a focus on P. brasiliense. The extensive phylogenetic analysis of the Pectobacterium genus showed robust distinct clades, with most detail provided by 452,388 parsimony-informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in single-copy orthologs. The average Pectobacterium genome consists of 47\% core genes, 1\% unique genes, and 52\% accessory genes. Using the pangenome, we zoomed in on differences between virulent and avirulent P. brasiliense strains and identified 86 genes associated to virulent strains. We found that the organization of genes is highly structured and linked with gene conservation, function, and transcriptional orientation. The pangenome analysis demonstrates that evolution in Pectobacteria is a highly dynamic process, including gene acquisitions partly in clusters, genome rearrangements, and loss of genes. Pectobacterium species are typically not characterized by a set of species-specific genes, but instead present themselves using new gene combinations from the shared gene pool. A multilevel pangenomic approach, fusing DNA, protein, biological function, taxonomic group, and phenotypes, facilitates studies in a flexible taxonomic context.},

	abstract = {For 3 years, PPanGGOLiN[1] (https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN) has emerged as a solid and widespread solution to construct and analyze prokaryotic pangenome graphs. In contrast to other tools, it is based on a graphical and statistical model to enable efficient and stable partitioning of pangenomes in persistent, shell and cloud genomes. Moreover, using the pangenome graph, PPanGGOLiN is able to identify regions of genomic plasticity (RGPs), their spots of insertions and their segmentation in conserved modules, with the panRGP[2] and panModule methods. 
With the ever-increasing number of genomes available in databases, it is essential to optimize the execution and storage capacities of PPanGGOLiN. Here we present the second version of PPanGGOLiN with technical improvements and code revision leading to a more effective data compression of the pangenome file as well as a better user experience. A configuration file can be used for reproducible and tunable analyses. Also, new features have been added in order to enable novel analyses. First, we included a feature allowing to cluster the RGPs based on their family content to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of mobile genetic elements (MGE). Also, the pangenome information (partition, RGPs, spots, modules, …) can be projected on multiple new genomes without recomputing the full pangenome. Furthermore,  a set of genes can be searched in the pangenome graph with the aim to extract their conserved genomic context. On top of this, metadata can be added to all pangenome elements and linked to PPanGGOLiN analyzes and outputs, such as functional annotation of gene families.
The aim of this new version of PPanGGOLiN is to continue facilitating the study of the evolutionary dynamics of prokaryotic species in the era of high-throughput genomics, paving the way for comparative pangenomics.

	abstract = {Objectives
A previous study showed higher prevalence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) expressing extended-spectrum \{\${\textbackslash}beta\$\}-lactamases (ESBL-Ec) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, compared with the general Dutch population. This study genetically characterised the ESBL-Ec isolates and investigated whether the increased prevalence could be explained by transmission between participants.
Methods
Whole-genome sequences were obtained from 93 unique ESBL-Ec isolates that were cultured from rectal swabs of 79 participants. Isolates were typed according to the Achtman MLST scheme and ESBL and virulence genes were identified. Pairwise SNP distances were determined between isolates. Isolate pairs with ≤ 25 SNPs were considered part of a putative transmission event, and events between multiple participants formed putative transmission clusters. To investigate whether putatively transmitted isolates belonged to globally expanded lineages, the level of hierarchical clustering with international isolates was assessed using core genome MLST (cgMLST) implemented on the Enterobase platform.
Results
The most frequently detected E. coli types were ST131:blaCTX-M-15 (16 of 117, 13.5\%), ST131:blaCTX-M-27, ST3075:blaCTX-M-15 and ST14:blaSHV-12 (all six of 117, 6.5\%). Fourteen putative transmission events were identified, forming four putative transmission clusters. The largest putative transmission cluster contained ST131 isolates, which clustered with multiple international isolates in SNP and cgMLST analysis. One other transmission cluster (ST14:blaSHV-12) and two transmission events (ST14:blaSHV-12 and ST394:blaCTX-M-15) contained very rarely reported strains.
Conclusions
The identification of unique ESBL-Ec strains involved in putative transmission and carried by multiple participants demonstrated a high probability of ESBL-Ec transmission between MSM in Amsterdam; therefore, ESBL-Ec infection should be considered in cases of sexually active MSM having associated symptoms.},

However, results of existing command-line software pipelines heavily depend on taxon-specific databases or sufficiently well annotated reference genomes. Here, we introduce Bakta, a new command-line software tool for the robust, taxon-independent, thorough and, nonetheless, fast annotation of bacterial genomes. Bakta conducts a comprehensive annotation workflow including the detection of small proteins taking into account replicon metadata. The annotation of coding sequences is accelerated via an alignment-free sequence identification approach that in addition facilitates the precise assignment of public database cross-references. Annotation results are exported in GFF3 and International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)-compliant flat files, as well as comprehensive JSON files, facilitating automated downstream analysis. We compared Bakta to other rapid contemporary command-line annotation software tools in both targeted and taxonomically broad benchmarks including isolates and metagenomic-assembled genomes. We demonstrated that Bakta outperforms other tools in terms of functional annotations, the assignment of functional categories and database cross-references, whilst providing comparable wall-clock runtimes. Bakta is implemented in Python 3 and runs on MacOS and Linux systems. It is freely available under a GPLv3 license at https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta.

	abstract = {Infections due to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria have become a major threat to global health. Some patients may carry resistant bacteria in their gut microbiota. Specific risk factors may trigger the conversion of these carriages into infections in hospitalized patients. Preventively eradicating these carriages has been postulated as a promising preventive intervention. However, previous attempts at such eradication using oral antibiotics or probiotics have led to discouraging results. Phage therapy, the therapeutic use of bacteriophage viruses, might represent a worthy alternative in this context. Taking inspiration from this clinical challenge, we built Gut-On-A-Chip (GOAC) models, which are tridimensional cell culture models mimicking a simplified gut section. These were used to better understand bacterial dynamics under phage pressure using two relevant species: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Model mucus secretion was documented by ELISA assays. Bacterial dynamics assays were performed in GOAC triplicates monitored for 72 h under numerous conditions, such as pre-, per-, or post-bacterial timing of phage introduction, punctual versus continuous phage administration, and phage expression of mucus-binding properties. The potential genomic basis of bacterial phage resistance acquired in the model was investigated by variant sequencing. The bacterial “escape growth” rates under phage pressure were compared to static in vitro conditions. Our results suggest that there is specific bacterial prosperity in this model compared to other in vitro conditions. In E. coli assays, the introduction of a phage harboring unique mucus-binding properties could not shift this balance of power, contradicting previous findings in an in vivo mouse model and highlighting the key differences between these models. Genomic modifications were correlated with bacterial phage resistance acquisition in some but not all instances, suggesting that alternate ways are needed to evade phage predation, which warrants further investigation.},

Here, we report on a new defence system, DISARM (defence island system associated with restriction–modification), which is widespread in bacteria and archaea. DISARM is composed of five genes, including a DNA methylase and four other genes annotated as a helicase domain, a phospholipase D (PLD) domain, a DUF1998 domain and a gene of unknown function. Engineering the Bacillus paralicheniformis 9945a DISARM system into Bacillus subtilis has rendered the engineered bacteria protected against phages from all three major families of tailed double-stranded DNA phages. Using a series of gene deletions, we show that four of the five genes are essential for DISARM-mediated defence, with the fifth (PLD) being redundant for defence against some of the phages. We further show that DISARM restricts incoming phage DNA and that the B. paralicheniformis DISARM methylase modifies host CCWGG motifs as a marker of self DNA akin to restriction–modification systems. Our results suggest that DISARM is a new type of multi-gene restriction–modification module, expanding the arsenal of defence systems known to be at the disposal of prokaryotes against their viruses.},

Such systems, which include the CRISPR‐Cas and restriction‐modification systems, have proven to be invaluable in the biotechnology and dairy industries. Here, we report on a six‐gene cassette in Bacillus cereus which, when integrated into the Bacillus subtilis genome, confers resistance to a broad range of phages, including both virulent and temperate ones. This cassette includes a putative Lon‐like protease, an alkaline phosphatase domain protein, a putative RNA‐binding protein, a DNA methylase, an ATPase‐domain protein, and a protein of unknown function. We denote this novel defense system BREX (Bacteriophage Exclusion) and show that it allows phage adsorption but blocks phage DNA replication. Furthermore, our results suggest that methylation on non‐palindromic TAGGAG motifs in the bacterial genome guides self/non‐self discrimination and is essential for the defensive function of the BREX system. However, unlike restriction‐modification systems, phage DNA does not appear to be cleaved or degraded by BREX, suggesting a novel mechanism of defense. Pan genomic analysis revealed that BREX and BREX‐like systems, including the distantly related Pgl system described in Streptomyces coelicolor, are widely distributed in {\textasciitilde}10\% of all sequenced microbial genomes and can be divided into six coherent subtypes in which the gene composition and order is conserved. Finally, we detected a phage family that evades the BREX defense, implying that anti‐BREX mechanisms may have evolved in some phages as part of their arms race with bacteria.},

The available data offers new opportunities to address questions about bacterial genome evolution, a task that requires reliable fine comparison data of closely related genomes. Recent analyses have shown, using pairwise whole genome alignments, that it is possible to segment bacterial genomes into a common conserved backbone and strain-specific sequences called loops. Here, we generalize this approach and propose a strategy that allows systematic and non-biased genome segmentation based on multiple genome alignments. Segmentation analyses, as applied to 13 different bacterial species, confirmed the feasibility of our approach to discern the 'mosaic' organization of bacterial genomes. Segmentation results are available through a Web interface permitting functional analysis, extraction and visualization of the backbone/loops structure of documented genomes. To illustrate the potential of this approach, we performed a precise analysis of the mosaic organization of three E. coli strains and functional characterization of the loops. The segmentation results including the backbone/loops structure of 13 bacterial species genomes are new and available for use by the scientific community at the URL: http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/mosaic .},

We screened solute-binding proteins (SBPs) for ABC transport systems and identified three that bind d-apiose, a branched pentose in the cell walls of higher plants. Guided by sequence similarity networks (SSNs) and genome neighborhood networks (GNNs), the identities of the SBPs enabled the discovery of four catabolic pathways for d-apiose with eleven previously unknown reactions. The new enzymes include d-apionate oxidoisomerase, which catalyzes hydroxymethyl group migration, as well as 3-oxo-isoapionate-4-phosphate decarboxylase and 3-oxo-isoapionate-4-phosphate transcarboxylase/hydrolase, which are RuBisCO-like proteins (RLPs). The web tools for generating SSNs and GNNs are publicly accessible (http://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-est/), so similar ‘genomic enzymology’ strategies for discovering novel pathways can be used by the community.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic profiles record the occurrence of homologs of genes across fully sequenced organisms. Proteins with similar profiles are typically components of protein complexes or metabolic pathways. Various existing methods measure similarity between two profiles and, hence, the likelihood that the two proteins co-evolve. Some methods ignore phylogenetic relationships between organisms while others account for such with metrics that explicitly model the likelihood of two proteins co-evolving on a tree. The latter methods more sensitively detect co-evolving proteins, but at a significant computational cost. Here we propose a novel heuristic to improve phylogenetic profile analysis that accounts for phylogenetic relationships between genomes in a computationally efficient fashion. We first order the genomes within profiles and then enumerate runs of consecutive matches and accurately compute the probability of observing these. We hypothesize that profiles with many runs are more likely to involve functionally related proteins than profiles in which all the matches are concentrated in one interval of the tree. We compared our approach to various previously published methods that both ignore and incorporate the underlying phylogeny between organisms. To evaluate performance, we compare the functional similarity of rank-ordered lists of protein pairs that share similar phylogenetic profiles by assessing significance of overlap in their Gene Ontology annotations. Accounting for runs in phylogenetic profile matches improves our ability to identify functionally related pairs of proteins. Furthermore, the networks that result from our approach tend to have smaller clusters of co-evolving proteins than networks computed using previous approaches and are thus more useful for inferring functional relationships. Finally, we report that our approach is orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than full tree-based methods. We have developed an improved method for analyzing phylogenetic profiles. The method allows us to more accurately and efficiently infer functional relationships between proteins based on these profiles than other published approaches. As the number of fully sequenced genomes increases, it becomes more important to account for evolutionary relationships among organisms in comparative analyses. Our approach, therefore, serves as an important example of how these relationships may be accounted for in an efficient manner.},

	abstract = {Microbial organisms have diverse populations, where using a single linear reference sequence in comparative studies introduces reference-bias in downstream analyses, and leads to a failure to account for variability in the population. Recently, pan-genome graphs have emerged as an alternative to the traditional linear reference with many successful applications and a rapid increase in the number of methods available in the literature. Despite this enthusiasm, there has been no attempt at exploring these graph construction methods in depth, demonstrating their practical use. In this study, we aim to develop a general guide to help researchers who may want to incorporate pan-genomes in their analyses of microbial organisms. We evaluated the state-of-the art pan-genome construction tools to model a collection of 70 Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Our results suggest that all tools produced pan-genome graphs conforming to our expectations based on previous literature, and that their approach to homologue detection is likely to be the most influential in determining the final size and complexity of the pan-genome. The graphs overlapped most in the core pan-genome content while the cloud genes varied significantly among tools. We propose an alternative approach for pan-genome construction by combining two of the tools, Panaroo and Ptolemy, to further exploit them in downstream analyses, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline for structural variant calling in beta-lactam resistance genes in the same set of A. baumannii isolates, identifying various transposon structures for carbapenem resistance in chromosome, as well as plasmids. We identify a novel plasmid structure in two multidrug-resistant clinical isolates that had previously been studied, and which could be important for their resistance phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Plasmids and temperate phages are key contributors to bacterial evolution. They are usually regarded as very distinct. However, some elements, termed phage–plasmids, are known to be both plasmids and phages, e.g. P1, N15 or SSU5. The number, distribution, relatedness and characteristics of these phage–plasmids are poorly known. Here, we screened for these elements among ca. 2500 phages and 12000 plasmids and identified 780 phage–plasmids across very diverse bacterial phyla. We grouped 92\% of them by similarity of gene repertoires to eight defined groups and 18 other broader communities of elements. The existence of these large groups suggests that phage–plasmids are ancient. Their gene repertoires are large, the average element is larger than an average phage or plasmid, and they include slightly more homologs to phages than to plasmids. We analyzed the pangenomes and the genetic organization of each group of phage–plasmids and found the key phage genes to be conserved and co-localized within distinct groups, whereas genes with homologs in plasmids are much more variable and include most accessory genes. Phage–plasmids are a sizeable fraction of the sequenced plasmids (∼7\%) and phages (∼5\%), and could have key roles in bridging the genetic divide between phages and other mobile genetic elements.},

	abstract = {The bacterial core genome is of intense interest and the volume of whole genome sequence data in the public domain available to investigate it has increased dramatically. The aim of our study was to develop a model to estimate the bacterial core genome from next-generation whole genome sequencing data and use this model to identify novel genes associated with important biological functions. Five bacterial datasets were analysed, comprising 2096 genomes in total. We developed a Bayesian decision model to estimate the number of core genes, calculated pairwise evolutionary distances (p-distances) based on nucleotide sequence diversity, and plotted the median p-distance for each core gene relative to its genome location. We designed visually-informative genome diagrams to depict areas of interest in genomes. Case studies demonstrated how the model could identify areas for further study, e.g. 25\% of the core genes with higher sequence diversity in the Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria meningitidis genomes encoded hypothetical proteins. The core gene with the highest p-distance value in C. jejuni was annotated in the reference genome as a putative hydrolase, but further work revealed that it shared sequence homology with beta-lactamase/metallo-beta-lactamases (enzymes that provide resistance to a range of broad-spectrum antibiotics) and thioredoxin reductase genes (which reduce oxidative stress and are essential for DNA replication) in other C. jejuni genomes. Our Bayesian model of estimating the core genome is principled, easy to use and can be applied to large genome datasets. This study also highlighted the lack of knowledge currently available for many core genes in bacterial genomes of significant global public health importance.},

Although ICEs and IMEs are widespread, they are as yet almost never annotated in public bacterial genomes. To address the need of dedicated strategies for the annotation of these elements, we developed ICEscreen, a tool that introduces two new features to detect ICEs and IMEs in Firmicute genomes. First, ICEscreen uses an efficient strategy to detect Signature Proteins of ICEs and IMEs based on a database dedicated to Firmicutes and composed of manually curated proteins and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) profiles. Second, ICEscreen includes a new original algorithm that detects composite structures of ICEs and IMEs that are frequent in genomes of Firmicutes but are currently not resolved by any other tool. We benchmarked ICEscreen on experimentally supported elements and on a public dataset of 246 manually annotated elements including the genomes of 40 Firmicutes and demonstrate its efficiency to detect ICEs and IMEs.},

It is found in a large number of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.The T2SSs of different species secrete a wide variety of folded exoproteins of different functions, shapes, sizes and quaternary structures. The T2SS secretion signal is still unknown, but it has been suggested that β-complementation is a feature of this signal.The T2SS contains several subassemblies: the outer-membrane secretin, the periplasmic pseudopilus and a cytoplasmic ATPase all interact with components of the inner-membrane platform.Crystal structures have been determined for the majority of T2SS domains, together with binary complexes showing the interaction of the inner-membrane platform with the ATPase and with the outer-membrane secretin, and a ternary complex of three pseudopilins forming the tip of the pseudopilus.Electron microscopy studies indicate that the outer-membrane complex is dodecameric, and indirect evidence suggests that the ATPase is hexameric. The stoichiometry of the inner-membrane platform is still largely a mystery.The current hypothesis regarding the mode of T2SS action is that an exoprotein is captured in the periplasmic vestibule of the outer-membrane secretin, possibly assisted by the inner-membrane protein GspC, and that this induces ATP hydrolysis by the ATPase, leading to conformational changes in the ATPase and the inner-membrane platform. This, in turn, results in elongation of the pseudopilus, which then functions as a piston, opening the periplasmic gate in the outer-membrane secretin to form a channel and then expelling the exoprotein.},

These exemplify two contrasting mechanisms for control of DNA break repair in which the RecBCD complex is either inhibited or co-opted for the benefit of the invading phage. Gp5.9 completely inhibits RecBCD by preventing it from binding to DNA. The RecBCD-gp5.9 structure shows that gp5.9 acts by substrate mimicry, binding predominantly to the RecB arm domain and competing sterically for the DNA binding site. Gp5.9 adopts a parallel coiled-coil architecture that is unprecedented for a natural DNA mimic protein. In contrast, binding of Abc2 does not substantially affect the biochemical activities of isolated RecBCD. The RecBCD-Abc2 structure shows that Abc2 binds to the Chi-recognition domains of the RecC subunit in a position that might enable it to mediate the loading of phage recombinases onto its single-stranded DNA products.},

Many computational tools have been developed to construct and annotate MAGs from metagenomic sequencing, however, there is a prominent gap to comprehensively introduce their background and practical performance. In this paper, we have thoroughly investigated the computational tools designed for both upstream and downstream analyses, including metagenome assembly, metagenome binning, gene prediction, functional annotation, taxonomic classification, and profiling. We have categorized the commonly used tools into unique groups based on their functional background and introduced the underlying core algorithms and associated information to demonstrate a comparative outlook. Furthermore, we have emphasized the computational requisition and offered guidance to the users to select the most efficient tools. Finally, we have indicated current limitations, potential solutions, and future perspectives for further improving the tools of MAG construction and annotation.

Therefore, this group represents an excellent framework to test the robustness of multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) not only for inferring phylogeny but also as an identification tool without the need for DNA-DNA hybridization assays. The genes selected, 16S rRNA, recA, pyrH, rpoD, gyrB, rctB and toxR, were amplified by direct PCR from 44 Vibrio core-group strains. Subsequent analysis allowed us to recognize toxR and rpoD as the most resolving individual genes and showed that concatenated sequences of rpoD, rctB and toxR were more useful than concatenated sequences of all seven genes. To validate our conclusions, MLSA similarities have been correlated with DNA-DNA relatedness values obtained in this study and values taken from the literature. Although the seven concatenated genes gave the best correlation, the concatenated sequences of rpoD, rctB and toxR have the practical advantage of showing a considerable gap between the maximal interspecies similarity and the minimal intraspecies similarity recorded, meaning that they can be used quite conveniently for species identification of vibrios.},

At present, DNA-DNA hybridizations are still considered the gold standard in species descriptions. However, this method is time-consuming and troublesome, and datasets can vary significantly between experiments as well as between laboratories. For the same reasons, full matrix hybridizations are rarely performed, weakening the significance of the results obtained. The authors established a universal sequencing approach for the three genes recN, rpoA and thdF for the Pasteurellaceae, and determined if the sequences could be used for predicting DNA-DNA relatedness within the family. The sequence-based similarity values calculated using a previously published formula proved most useful for species and genus separation, indicating that this method provides better resolution and no experimental variation compared to hybridization. By this method, cross-comparisons within the family over species and genus borders easily become possible. The three genes also serve as an indicator of the genome G+C content of a species. A mean divergence of around 1 \% was observed from the classical method, which in itself has poor reproducibility. Finally, the three genes can be used alone or in combination with already-established 16S rRNA, rpoB and infB gene-sequencing strategies in a multisequence-based phylogeny for the family Pasteurellaceae. It is proposed to use the three sequences as a taxonomic tool, replacing DNA-DNA hybridization.},

Single isolates of both M. ulcerans and M. marinum that were shown by the sequence analysis to be the most closely related were then selected for further study. One- and two-dimensional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was employed to compare the architecture and size of the genome from each species. Genome sizes of approximately 4.4 and 4.6 Mb were obtained for M. ulcerans and M. marinum, respectively. Significant macrorestriction fragment polymorphism was observed between the species. However, hybridization analysis of DNA cleaved with more frequently cutting enzymes identified significant preservation of the flanking sequence at seven of the eight loci sequenced. The exception was the 16S rRNA locus. Two high-copy-number insertion sequences, IS2404 and IS2606, have recently been reported in M. ulcerans, and significantly, these elements are not present in M. marinum. Hybridization of the AseI restriction fragments from M. ulcerans with IS2404 and IS2606 indicated widespread genome distribution for both of these repeated sequences. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that M. ulcerans has recently diverged from M. marinum by the acquisition and concomitant loss of DNA in a manner analogous to the emergence of M. tuberculosis, where species diversity is being driven mainly by the activity of mobile DNA elements.},

	abstract = {A new taxonomy of the green sulfur bacteria is proposed, based on phylogenetic relationships determined using the sequences of the independent 16S rRNA and fmo (Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein) genes, and supported by the DNA G + C content and sequence signatures. Comparison of the traditional classification system for these bacteria with their phylogenetic relationship yielded a confusing picture, because properties used for classification (such as cell morphology, photosynthetic pigments and substrate utilization) do not concur with their phylogeny. Using the genetic information available, strains and species assigned to the genera Chlorobium, Pelodictyon and Prosthecochloris are considered, and the following changes are proposed. Pelodictyon luteolum is transferred to the genus Chlorobium as Chlorobium luteolum comb. nov. Pelodictyon clathratiforme and Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme are transferred to the genus Chlorobium and combined into one species, Chlorobium clathratiforme comb. nov. The name Pelodictyon will become a synonym of Chlorobium. Strains known as Chlorobium limicola subsp. thiosulfatophilum that have a low DNA G + C content (52-52.5 mol\%) are treated as strains of Chlorobium limicola; those with a high DNA G + C content (58.1 mol\%) are transferred to Chlorobaculum gen. nov., as Chlorobaculum thiosulfatiphilum sp. nov. Chlorobium tepidum is transferred to Chlorobaculum tepidum comb. nov., and defined as the type species of the genus Chlorobaculum. Strains assigned to Chlorobium phaeobacteroides, but phylogenetically distant from the type strain of this species, are assigned to Chlorobium limicola and to Chlorobaculum limnaeum sp. nov. Strains known as Chlorobium vibrioforme subsp. thiosulfatophilum are transferred to Chlorobaculum parvum sp. nov. Chlorobium chlorovibrioides is transferred to 'Chlorobaculum chlorovibrioides' comb. nov. The type strain of Chlorobium vibrioforme is phylogenetically related to Prosthecochloris, and is therefore transferred to this genus as Prosthecochloris vibrioformis comb. nov. Consequently, the name Chlorobium vibrioforme will become a synonym of Prosthecochloris vibrioformis, and other strains that were assigned to this species are now considered to belong to Chlorobium luteolum, Chlorobium phaeovibrioides and 'Chlorobaculum chlorovibrioides', according to their phylogenetic relatedness.},

To evaluate the influence of selection on gene content variation in hydrothermal vent microbial populations, we examined 22 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) (70 to 97\% complete) from the ubiquitous vent Epsilonbacteraeota genus Sulfurovum that were recovered from two deep-sea hydrothermal vent regions, Axial Seamount in the northeastern Pacific Ocean (13 MAGs) and the Mid-Cayman Rise in the Caribbean Sea (9 MAGs). Genes involved in housekeeping functions were highly conserved across Sulfurovum lineages. However, genes involved in environment-specific functions, and in particular phosphate regulation, were found mostly in Sulfurovum genomes from the Mid-Cayman Rise in the low-phosphate Atlantic Ocean environment, suggesting that nutrient limitation is an important selective pressure for these bacteria. Furthermore, genes that were rare within the pangenome were more likely to undergo positive selection than genes that were highly conserved in the pangenome, and they also appeared to have experienced gene-specific sweeps. Our results suggest that selection is a significant driver of gene gain and loss for dominant microbial lineages in hydrothermal vents and highlight the importance of factors like nutrient limitation in driving microbial adaptation and evolution.IMPORTANCE Microbes can alter their gene content through the gain and loss of genes. However, there is some debate as to whether natural selection or neutral processes play a stronger role in molding the gene content of microbial genomes. In this study, we examined variation in gene content for the Epsilonbacteraeota genus Sulfurovum from deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which are dynamic habitats known for extensive horizontal gene transfer within microbial populations. Our results show that natural selection is a strong driver of Sulfurovum gene content and that nutrient limitation in particular has shaped the Sulfurovum genome, leading to differences in gene content between ocean basins. Our results also suggest that recently acquired genes undergo stronger selection than genes that were acquired in the more distant past. Overall, our results highlight the importance of natural selection in driving the evolution of microbial populations in these dynamic habitats.},

Several thousand complete or nearly complete Streptomyces genome sequences are now available, affording the opportunity to deeply investigate the biosynthetic potential within these organisms and to advance natural product discovery initiatives. We perform pangenome analysis on 2371 Streptomyces genomes, including approximately 1200 complete assemblies. Employing a data-driven approach based on genome similarities, the Streptomyces genus was classified into 7 primary and 42 secondary Mash-clusters, forming the basis for comprehensive pangenome mining. A refined workflow for grouping biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) redefines their diversity across different Mash-clusters. This workflow also reassigns 2729 known BGC families to only 440 families, a reduction caused by inaccuracies in BGC boundary detections. When the genomic location of BGCs is included in the analysis, a conserved genomic structure, or synteny, among BGCs becomes apparent within species and Mash-clusters. This synteny suggests that vertical inheritance is a major factor in the diversification of BGCs. Our analysis of a genomic dataset at a scale of thousands of genomes refines predictions of BGC diversity using Mash-clusters as a basis for pangenome analysis. The observed conservation in the order of BGCs’ genomic locations shows that the BGCs are vertically inherited.

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important global health threat that impacts millions of people worldwide each year. Developing methods that can detect and predict AMR phenotypes can help to mitigate the spread of AMR by informing clinical decision making and appropriate mitigation strategies. Many bioinformatic methods have been developed for predicting AMR phenotypes from whole-genome sequences and AMR genes, but recent studies have indicated that predictions can be made from incomplete genome sequence data. In order to more systematically understand this, we built random forest-based machine learning classifiers for predicting susceptible and resistant phenotypes for Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,640 strains), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2,497 strains), and Salmonella enterica (1,981 strains). We started by building models from alignments that were based on a reference chromosome for each species. We then subsampled each chromosomal alignment and built models for the resulting subalignments, finding that very small regions, representing approximately 0.1 to 0.2\% of the chromosome, are predictive. In K. pneumoniae, M. tuberculosis, and S. enterica, the subalignments are able to predict multiple AMR phenotypes with at least 70\% accuracy, even though most do not encode an AMR-related function. We used these models to identify regions of the chromosome with high and low predictive signals. Finally, subalignments that retain high accuracy across larger phylogenetic distances were examined in greater detail, revealing genes and intergenic regions with potential links to AMR, virulence, transport, and survival under stress conditions.IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance causes thousands of deaths annually worldwide. Understanding the regions of the genome that are involved in antimicrobial resistance is important for developing mitigation strategies and preventing transmission. Machine learning models are capable of predicting antimicrobial resistance phenotypes from bacterial genome sequence data by identifying resistance genes, mutations, and other correlated features. They are also capable of implicating regions of the genome that have not been previously characterized as being involved in resistance. In this study, we generated global chromosomal alignments for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Salmonella enterica and systematically searched them for small conserved regions of the genome that enable the prediction of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. In addition to known antimicrobial resistance genes, this analysis identified genes involved in virulence and transport functions, as well as many genes with no previous implication in antimicrobial resistance.},

To date, only species-specific machine learning models have been developed, and to the best of our knowledge, the inclusion of information from multiple species has not been attempted. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of including information from multiple bacterial species to predict AMR for an individual species, since this may make it easier to train and update resistance predictions for multiple species and may lead to improved predictions. Whole-genome sequence data and susceptibility profiles from 3,528 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 1,694 Escherichia coli, 658 Salmonella enterica, and 1,236 Staphylococcus aureus isolates were included. We developed machine learning models trained by the features of the PointFinder and ResFinder programs detected to predict binary (susceptible/resistant) AMR profiles. We tested four feature representation methods to determine the most efficient way for introducing features into the models. When training the model only on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, high prediction performances were obtained for the six AMR profiles included. By adding information on ciprofloxacin from the additional 3,588 isolates, there was no reduction in performance for the other antimicrobials but an increased performance for ciprofloxacin AMR profile prediction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli. In conclusion, the species-independent models can predict multi-AMR profiles for multiple species without losing any robustness.IMPORTANCE Machine learning is a proven method to predict AMR; however, the performance of any machine learning model depends on the quality of the input data. Therefore, we evaluated different methods of representing information about mutations as well as mobilizable genes, so that the information can serve as input for a robust model. We combined data from multiple bacterial species in order to develop species-independent machine learning models that can predict resistance profiles for multiple antimicrobials and species with high performance.},

However, routine use of WGS-based AST is hindered by the need for bioinformatics skills and knowledge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants to operate the vast majority of tools developed to date. By leveraging on ResFinder and PointFinder, two freely accessible tools that can also assist users without bioinformatics skills, we aimed at increasing their speed and providing an easily interpretable antibiogram as output.The ResFinder code was re-written to process raw reads and use Kmer-based alignment. The existing ResFinder and PointFinder databases were revised and expanded. Additional databases were developed including a genotype-to-phenotype key associating each AMR determinant with a phenotype at the antimicrobial compound level, and species-specific panels for in silico antibiograms. ResFinder 4.0 was validated using Escherichia coli (n = 584), Salmonella spp. (n = 1081), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 239), Enterococcus faecium (n = 106), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 50) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 163) exhibiting different AST profiles, and from different human and animal sources and geographical origins.Genotype–phenotype concordance was ≥95\% for 46/51 and 25/32 of the antimicrobial/species combinations evaluated for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. When genotype–phenotype concordance was \&lt;95\%, discrepancies were mainly linked to criteria for interpretation of phenotypic tests and suboptimal sequence quality, and not to ResFinder 4.0 performance.WGS-based AST using ResFinder 4.0 provides in silico antibiograms as reliable as those obtained by phenotypic AST at least for the bacterial species/antimicrobial agents of major public health relevance considered.},

	abstract = {Identification of antimicrobial resistance genes is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms and the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. As the costs of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) continue to decline, it becomes increasingly available in routine diagnostic laboratories and is anticipated to substitute traditional methods for resistance gene identification. Thus, the current challenge is to extract the relevant information from the large amount of generated data.We developed a web-based method, ResFinder that uses BLAST for identification of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in whole-genome data. As input, the method can use both pre-assembled, complete or partial genomes, and short sequence reads from four different sequencing platforms. The method was evaluated on 1862 GenBank files containing 1411 different resistance genes, as well as on 23 de-novo-sequenced isolates.When testing the 1862 GenBank files, the method identified the resistance genes with an ID = 100\% (100\% identity) to the genes in ResFinder. Agreement between in silico predictions and phenotypic testing was found when the method was further tested on 23 isolates of five different bacterial species, with available phenotypes. Furthermore, ResFinder was evaluated on WGS chromosomes and plasmids of 30 isolates. Seven of these isolates were annotated to have antimicrobial resistance, and in all cases, annotations were compatible with the ResFinder results.A web server providing a convenient way of identifying acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in completely sequenced isolates was created. ResFinder can be accessed at www.genomicepidemiology.org. ResFinder will continuously be updated as new resistance genes are identified.},

	abstract = {Microbes affect each other’s growth in multiple, often elusive, ways. The ensuing interdependencies form complex networks, believed to reflect taxonomic composition as well as community-level functional properties and dynamics. The elucidation of these networks is often pursued by measuring pairwise interactions in coculture experiments. However, the combinatorial complexity precludes an exhaustive experimental analysis of pairwise interactions, even for moderately sized microbial communities. Here, we used a machine learning random forest approach to address this challenge. In particular, we show how partial knowledge of a microbial interaction network, combined with trait-level representations of individual microbial species, can provide accurate inference of missing edges in the network and putative mechanisms underlying the interactions. We applied our algorithm to three case studies: an experimentally mapped network of interactions between auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains, a community of soil microbes, and a large in silico network of metabolic interdependencies between 100 human gut-associated bacteria. For this last case, 5\% of the network was sufficient to predict the remaining 95\% with 80\% accuracy, and the mechanistic hypotheses produced by the algorithm accurately reflected known metabolic exchanges. Our approach, broadly applicable to any microbial or other ecological network, may drive the discovery of new interactions and new molecular mechanisms, both for therapeutic interventions involving natural communities and for the rational design of synthetic consortia.IMPORTANCE Different organisms in a microbial community may drastically affect each other’s growth phenotypes, significantly affecting the community dynamics, with important implications for human and environmental health. Novel culturing methods and the decreasing costs of sequencing will gradually enable high-throughput measurements of pairwise interactions in systematic coculturing studies. However, a thorough characterization of all interactions that occur within a microbial community is greatly limited both by the combinatorial complexity of possible assortments and by the limited biological insight that interaction measurements typically provide without laborious specific follow-ups. Here, we show how a simple and flexible formal representation of microbial pairs can be used for the classification of interactions via machine learning. The approach we propose predicts with high accuracy the outcome of yet-to-be performed experiments and generates testable hypotheses about the mechanisms of specific interactions.},

Here we present the novel metagenome classifier Kaiju, which finds maximum (in-)exact matches on the protein-level using the Burrows–Wheeler transform. We show in a genome exclusion benchmark that Kaiju classifies reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared with current k-mer-based classifiers, especially in genera that are underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that Kaiju classifies up to 10 times more reads in real metagenomes. Kaiju can process millions of reads per minute and can run on a standard PC.

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most important health threats globally. The ability to accurately identify resistant bacterial isolates and the individual antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) is essential for understanding the evolution and emergence of AMR and to provide appropriate treatment. The rapid developments in next-generation sequencing technologies have made this technology available to researchers and microbiologists at routine laboratories around the world. However, tools available for those with limited experience with bioinformatics are lacking, especially to enable researchers and microbiologists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to perform their own studies. The CGE-tools (Center for Genomic Epidemiology) including ResFinder (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ResFinder/) was developed to provide freely available easy to use online bioinformatic tools allowing inexperienced researchers and microbiologists to perform simple bioinformatic analyses. The main purpose was and is to provide these solutions for people involved in frontline diagnosis especially in LMICs. Since its original publication in 2012, ResFinder has undergone a number of improvements including improvement of the code and databases, inclusion of point mutations for selected bacterial species and predictions of phenotypes also for selected species. As of 28 September 2021, 820 803 analyses have been performed using ResFinder from 61 776 IP-addresses in 171 countries. ResFinder clearly fulfills a need for several people around the globe and we hope to be able to continue to provide this service free of charge in the future. We also hope and expect to provide further improvements including phenotypic predictions for additional bacterial species.},

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

	abstract = {Bacteria produce a large variety of antimicrobial compounds directed against other bacterial species competing for the same resources. To mount an effective attack on their competitors some bacteria coordinate the production of toxins through intercellular communication with secreted species or strain-specific signalling molecules. To avoid suicide, producers also coordinate the expression of immunity proteins to protect themselves against their own toxins. Recently it has been discovered that in some cases subpopulations of isogenic bacteria can direct their weaponry against their own siblings. This phenomenon occurs in Streptococcus pneumoniae during natural transformation and in starving cells of Bacillus subtilis, and has been termed fratricide and cannibalism, respectively.Cannibalism takes place during the early stages of sporulation in B. subtilis, when the bacterial population suffer from severe nutritional stress. Under such conditions, cells that have reached a certain stage in their sporulation differentiation process launch a coordinated attack on their siblings by secreting bacteriocin-like toxins. The targeted cells have not reached the same level of differentiation as their attackers, and therefore do not express the immunity proteins needed to fend off the attack. This behaviour was termed cannibalism as it causes the release of nutrients that the attacking cells can feed on to avoid, or at least delay, entry into sporulation.Fratricide takes place in mixed populations of competent and non-competent pneumococci. Competent pneumococci secrete toxins that lyse their non-competent sister cells, liberating DNA and other cell constituents. This DNA-release mechanism is believed to increase the efficiency of gene exchange between pneumococci and other closely related streptococcal species under natural conditions. Evidence indicates that fratricide also contributes to virulence during human infections, as it mediates the release of the important virulence factor pneumolysin.Cannibalism and fratricide represent interesting examples of a new kind of collaborative behaviour in bacteria. In these cases, some members of a population of isogenic bacteria (a subgroup), collaborate to attack their siblings. Previously, such collaborative behaviour has only been described for 'chemical warfare' between genetically non-identical bacteria.},

In Streptococcus pneumoniae, a species which belongs to the latter group, SOS response inducers (e.g., mitomycin C [Mc] and fluoroquinolones) were shown to induce natural transformation, leading to the hypothesis that DNA damage-induced competence could contribute to genomic plasticity and stress resistance. Using reporter strains and microarray experiments, we investigated the impact of the SOS response inducers mitomycin C and norfloxacin and the role of HdiR on competence development in Streptococcus thermophilus. We show that both the addition of SOS response inducers and HdiR inactivation have a dual effect, i.e., induction of the expression of SOS genes and reduction of transformability. Reduction of transformability results from two different mechanisms, since HdiR inactivation has no major effect on the expression of competence (com) genes, while mitomycin C downregulates the expression of early and late com genes in a dose-dependent manner. The downregulation of com genes by mitomycin C was shown to take place at the level of the activation of the ComRS signaling system by an unknown mechanism. Conversely, we show that a ComX-deficient strain is more resistant to mitomycin C and norfloxacin in a viability plate assay, which indicates that competence development negatively affects the resistance of S. thermophilus to DNA-damaging agents. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that SOS response activation and competence development are antagonistic processes in S. thermophilus.},

The recA mutation has been shown to confer both DNA repair (as judged from sensitivity to u.v. and methyl methane sulphonate) and recombination deficiencies. Plasmid transformation into the recA mutant was also drastically reduced. Western blotting established that recA gene expression is increased several fold at the onset of competence for genetic transformation, increased expression was associated with the appearance of a recA-specific transcript, approximately 5.7 kb long. This transcript indicated that recA is part of a competence-inducible (cin) operon. The major (about 4.3 kb) transcript detected from non-competent cells did not include cinA, the first gene in the operon, suggesting that this gene could be specifically required at some stage in the transformation process. Detection of small amounts of the 5.7 kb polycistronic mRNA in cells treated with mitomycin C suggested that the operon could also be damage inducible. In addition, mitomycin C treatment of a recA lysogenic strain did not lead to prophage induction and cell lysis. This is unlike the situation of a recA+ lysogen. Together these results demonstrate that RecA controls lysogenic induction and suggest the existence of a SOS repair system in S. pneumoniae.},

They allow for data-driven genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic characterizations, but require state-of-the-art ‘big data’ computing strategies, with abstraction levels beyond available tool capabilities.Results: We propose a high-level, declarative GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL) and a toolkit for its use. GMQL operates downstream of raw data preprocessing pipelines and supports queries over thousands of heterogeneous datasets and samples; as such it is key to genomic ‘big data’ analysis. GMQL leverages a simple data model that provides both abstractions of genomic region data and associated experimental, biological and clinical metadata and interoperability between many data formats. Based on Hadoop framework and Apache Pig platform, GMQL ensures high scalability, expressivity, flexibility and simplicity of use, as demonstrated by several biological query examples on ENCODE and TCGA datasets.Availability and implementation: The GMQL toolkit is freely available for non-commercial use at http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/GMQL/.Contact:  marco.masseroli@polimi.itSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {While a huge amount of (epi)genomic data of multiple types is becoming available by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, the most important emerging problem is the so-called tertiary analysis, concerned with sense making, e.g., discovering how different (epi)genomic regions and their products interact and cooperate with each other. We propose a paradigm shift in tertiary analysis, based on the use of the Genomic Data Model (GDM), a simple data model which links genomic feature data to their associated experimental, biological and clinical metadata. GDM encompasses all the data formats which have been produced for feature extraction from (epi)genomic datasets. We specifically describe the mapping to GDM of SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), VCF (Variant Call Format), NARROWPEAK (for called peaks produced by NGS ChIP-seq or DNase-seq methods), and BED (Browser Extensible Data) formats, but GDM supports as well all the formats describing experimental datasets (e.g., including copy number variations, DNA somatic mutations, or gene expressions) and annotations (e.g., regarding transcription start sites, genes, enhancers or CpG islands). We downloaded and integrated samples of all the above-mentioned data types and formats from multiple sources. The GDM is able to homogeneously describe semantically heterogeneous data and makes the ground for providing data interoperability, e.g., achieved through the GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL), a high-level, declarative query language for genomic big data. The combined use of the data model and the query language allows comprehensive processing of multiple heterogeneous data, and supports the development of domain-specific data-driven computations and bio-molecular knowledge discovery.},

	abstract = {Public health laboratories are currently moving to whole-genome sequence (WGS)-based analyses, and require the rapid prediction of standard reference laboratory methods based solely on genomic data. Currently, these predictive genomics tasks rely on workflows that chain together multiple programs for the requisite analyses. While useful, these systems do not store the analyses in a genome-centric way, meaning the same analyses are often re-computed for the same genomes.
To solve this problem, we created Spfy, a platform that rapidly performs the common reference laboratory tests, uses a graph database to store and retrieve the results from the computational workflows and links data to individual genomes using standardized ontologies. The Spfy platform facilitates rapid phenotype identification, as well as the efficient storage and downstream comparative analysis of tens of thousands of genome sequences. Though generally applicable to bacterial genome sequences, Spfy currently contains 10 243 Escherichia coli genomes, for which in-silico serotype and Shiga-toxin subtype, as well as the presence of known virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants have been computed. Additionally, the presence/absence of the entire E. coli pan-genome was computed and linked to each genome. Owing to its database of diverse pre-computed results, and the ability to easily incorporate user data, Spfy facilitates hypothesis testing in fields ranging from population genomics to epidemiology, while mitigating the re-computation of analyses. The graph approach of Spfy is flexible, and can accommodate new analysis software modules as they are developed, easily linking new results to those already stored. Spfy provides a database and analyses approach for E. coli that is able to match the rapid accumulation of WGS data in public databases.},

Pathway maps are the primary dataset in KEGG representing systemic functions of the cell and the organism in terms of molecular interaction and reaction networks. The KEGG Orthology (KO) system is a mechanism for linking genes and proteins to pathway maps and other molecular networks. Each KO is a generic gene identifier and each pathway map is created as a network of KO nodes. This architecture enables KEGG pathway mapping to uncover systemic features from KO assigned genomes and metagenomes. Additional roles of KOs include characterization of conserved genes and conserved units of genes in organism groups, which can be done by taxonomy mapping. A new tool has been developed for identifying conserved gene orders in chromosomes, in which gene orders are treated as sequences of KOs. Furthermore, a new dataset called VOG (virus ortholog group) is computationally generated from virus proteins and expanded to proteins of cellular organisms, allowing gene orders to be compared as VOG sequences as well. Together with these datasets and analysis tools, new types of pathway maps are being developed to present a global view of biological processes involving multiple organism groups.},

In this work, we survey the literature to explore the evolution, performance and how the most recent graph database solutions are applied in the biomedical domain, compiling a great variety of use cases.

By gathering related data as closer as it could be to reduce the data transformation cost on the network and improve the performance in terms of database usage. The CA\_Sqoop also considers the table correlation and size for better data locality and query efficiency. Simulation results show that data locality of CA\_Sqoop is two times better than that of original Apache Sqoop.},

Clustering of protein sequence space based on sequence similarity helps organize all sequences into manageable datasets and reduces sampling bias and overrepresentation of sequences.Results: The UniRef (UniProt Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and selected UniProt Archive records to obtain complete coverage of sequence space at several resolutions while hiding redundant sequences. Currently covering \&gt;4 million source sequences, the UniRef100 database combines identical sequences and subfragments from any source organism into a single UniRef entry. UniRef90 and UniRef50 are built by clustering UniRef100 sequences at the 90 or 50\% sequence identity levels. UniRef100, UniRef90 and UniRef50 yield a database size reduction of ∼10, 40 and 70\%, respectively, from the source sequence set.

	abstract = {Better interrogation of antimicrobial resistance requires new approaches to detect the associated genes in metagenomic samples. Targeted enrichment is an ideal method for their sequencing and characterization. However, no open-source, up-to-date hybridization probe set targeting antimicrobial resistance genes exists. Here we describe CARPDM, a probe design software package made to run alongside all future Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database releases. To test its efficacy, we have created and validated two separate probe sets: AllCARD, which enriches all genes encoded in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database’s protein homolog models (n = 4,661), and clinicalCARD, which focuses on a clinically relevant subset of resistance genes (n = 323). We demonstrate that allCARD increases the number of reads mapping to resistance genes by up to 594-fold. ClinicalCARD performs similarly when clinically relevant genes are present, increasing the number of resistance-gene mapping reads by up to 598-fold. In parallel with this development, we have established a protocol to synthesize any probe set in-house, saving up to 350 dollars per reaction. Together, these probe sets, their associated design program CARPDM, and the protocol for in-house synthesis will democratize metagenomic resistome analyses, allowing researchers access to a cost-effective and efficient means to explore the antibiotic resistome.},

Despite the fact that the first genomes sequenced of free living organisms were those of bacteria, there have been few specialized bioinformatic tools developed to mine the growing amount of genomic data associated with pathogens. In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The CARD integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences. This unique platform provides an informatic tool that bridges antibiotic resistance concerns in health care, agriculture, and the environment.},

This collection is now organised into a relational database making it possible to understand the genomic context of the protein through navigation back to the source assembly and sample metadata, marking a major improvement. To extend beyond the functional annotations already provided in MGnify, we have applied deep learning-based annotation methods.

	abstract = {The recent years have seen the rise of pangenomes as comparative genomic tools to better understand the evolution of gene content among microbial genomes in close phylogenetic groups such as species. While the core or persistent genome is often well-known as it includes essential or ubiquitous genes, the variable genome is usually less characterized and includes many genes with unknown functions even among the most studied organisms. It gathers important genes for strain adaptation that are acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Here, we introduce panModule, an original method to identify conserved modules in pangenome graphs built from thousands of microbial genomes. These modules correspond to synteny blocks composed of consecutive genes that are conserved in a subset of the compared strains. Identifying conserved modules can provide insights on genes involved in the same functional processes, and as such is a very helpful tool to facilitate the understanding of genomic regions with complex evolutionary histories. The panModule method was benchmarked on a curated dataset of conserved modules in Escherichia coli genomes. Its use was illustrated through a study of a high pathogenicity island in Klebsiella pneumoniae that allowed a better understanding of this region. panModule is freely available and accessible through the PPanGGOLiN software suite (https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN).},

Existing approaches either lack functional annotation of the identified orthologous groups, hampering the interpretation of subsequent results, or are manually annotated and thus lag behind the rapid sequencing of new genomes. Here we present the eggNOG database (‘evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups’), which contains orthologous groups constructed from Smith–Waterman alignments through identification of reciprocal best matches and triangular linkage clustering. Applying this procedure to 312 bacterial, 26 archaeal and 35 eukaryotic genomes yielded 43 582 course-grained orthologous groups of which 9724 are extended versions of those from the original COG/KOG database. We also constructed more fine-grained groups for selected subsets of organisms, such as the 19 914 mammalian orthologous groups. We automatically annotated our non-supervised orthologous groups with functional descriptions, which were derived by identifying common denominators for the genes based on their individual textual descriptions, annotated functional categories, and predicted protein domains. The orthologous groups in eggNOG contain 1 241 751 genes and provide at least a broad functional description for 77\% of them.

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming a huge problem in both developed and developing countries, and identifying strains resistant or susceptible to certain antibiotics is essential in fighting against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Whole-genome sequences have been collected for different microbial strains in order to identify crucial characteristics that allow certain strains to become resistant to antibiotics; however, a global inspection of the gene content responsible for AMR activities remains to be done.We propose a pan-genome-based approach to characterize antibiotic-resistant microbial strains and test this approach on the bacterial model organism Escherichia coli. By identifying core and accessory gene clusters and predicting AMR genes for the E. coli pan-genome, we not only showed that certain classes of genes are unevenly distributed between the core and accessory parts of the pan-genome but also demonstrated that only a portion of the identified AMR genes belong to the accessory genome. Application of machine learning algorithms to predict whether specific strains were resistant to antibiotic drugs yielded the best prediction accuracy for the set of AMR genes within the accessory part of the pan-genome, suggesting that these gene clusters were most crucial to AMR activities in E. coli. Selecting subsets of AMR genes for different antibiotic drugs based on a genetic algorithm (GA) achieved better prediction performances than the gene sets established in the literature, hinting that the gene sets selected by the GA may warrant further analysis in investigating more details about how E. coli fight against antibiotics.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In turn, phages can acquire counter-defense systems, but it remains unclear how such mechanisms arise and what factors constrain viral evolution. Here, we experimentally evolved T4 phage to overcome a phage-defensive toxin-antitoxin system, toxIN, in Escherichia coli. Through recombination, T4 rapidly acquires segmental amplifications of a previously uncharacterized gene, now named tifA, encoding an inhibitor of the toxin, ToxN. These amplifications subsequently drive large deletions elsewhere in T4’s genome to maintain a genome size compatible with capsid packaging. The deleted regions include accessory genes that help T4 overcome defense systems in alternative hosts. Thus, our results reveal a trade-off in viral evolution; the emergence of one counter-defense mechanism can lead to loss of other such mechanisms, thereby constraining host range. We propose that the accessory genomes of viruses reflect the integrated evolutionary history of the hosts they infected.},

	abstract = {Species phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary processes of organisms, and they are fundamental in evolutionary research. Therefore, new methods have been developed to obtain more reliable species phylogenetic trees. A highly reliable method is the construction of an ortholog data set based on sequence information of genes, which is then used to infer the species phylogenetic tree. However, although methods for constructing an ortholog data set for species phylogenetic analysis have been developed, they cannot remove some paralogs, which is necessary for reliable species phylogenetic inference. To address the limitations of current methods, we developed OrthoPhy, a program that excludes paralogs and constructs highly accurate ortholog data sets using taxonomic information dividing analyzed species into monophyletic groups. OrthoPhy can remove paralogs, detecting inconsistencies between taxonomic information and phylogenetic trees of candidate ortholog groups clustered by sequence similarity. Performance tests using evolutionary simulated sequences and real sequences of 40 bacteria revealed that the precision of ortholog inference by OrthoPhy is higher than that of existing programs. Additionally, the phylogenetic analysis of species was more accurate when performed using ortholog data sets constructed by OrthoPhy than that performed using data sets constructed by existing programs. Furthermore, we performed a benchmark test of the Quest for Orthologs using real sequence data and found that the concordance rate between the phylogenetic trees of orthologs inferred by OrthoPhy and those of species was higher than the rates obtained by other ortholog inference programs.

The Orthologous MAtrix (OMA) database is a leading resource for identifying orthologs among publicly available, complete genomes. Here, we describe the OMA pipeline available as a standalone program for Linux and Mac. When run on a cluster, it has native support for the LSF, SGE, PBS Pro, and Slurm job schedulers and can scale up to thousands of parallel processes. Another key feature of OMA standalone is that users can combine their own data with existing public data by exporting genomes and precomputed alignments from the OMA database, which currently contains over 2100 complete genomes. We compare OMA standalone to other methods in the context of phylogenetic tree inference, by inferring a phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa, a challenging clade within the protostomes. We also discuss other potential applications of OMA standalone, including identifying gene families having undergone duplications/losses in specific clades, and identifying potential drug targets in nonmodel organisms.

	abstract = {Gene homology type classification is required for many types of genome analyses, including comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and protein function annotation. Consequently, a large variety of tools have been developed to perform homology classification across genomes of different species. However, when applied to large genomic data sets, these tools require high memory and CPU usage, typically available only in computational clusters.Here we present a new graph-based orthology analysis tool, SwiftOrtho, which is optimized for speed and memory usage when applied to large-scale data. SwiftOrtho uses long k-mers to speed up homology search, while using a reduced amino acid alphabet and spaced seeds to compensate for the loss of sensitivity due to long k-mers. In addition, it uses an affinity propagation algorithm to reduce the memory usage when clustering large-scale orthology relationships into orthologous groups. In our tests, SwiftOrtho was the only tool that completed orthology analysis of proteins from 1,760 bacterial genomes on a computer with only 4 GB RAM. Using various standard orthology data sets, we also show that SwiftOrtho has a high accuracy.SwiftOrtho enables the accurate comparative genomic analyses of thousands of genomes using low-memory computers.

Annotation of the whole-genome sequencing of UMN026, a reference CGA strain, clarified the genetic basis for this strain's ACSSuTTp antimicrobial resistance phenotype. Most of the responsible genes were clustered in a unique 23-kbp chromosomal region, designated the genomic resistance module (GRM), which occurred within a 105-kbp genomic island situated at the leuX tRNA. The GRM is characterized by numerous remnants of mobilization and rearrangement events suggesting multiple horizontal transfers. Additionally, comparative genomic analysis of the leuX tRNA genomic island in 14 sequenced E. coli genomes showed that this region is a hot spot of integration, with the presence/absence of specific subregions being uncorrelated with either the phylogenetic group or the pathotype. Our data illustrate the importance of whole-genome sequencing in the detection of genetic elements involved in antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, this is the first documentation of the blaTEM and dhfrVII genes in a chromosomal location in E. coli strains.},

	abstract = {The Escherichia coli species represents one of the best-studied model organisms, but also encompasses a variety of commensal and pathogenic strains that diversify by high rates of genetic change. We uniformly (re-) annotated the genomes of 20 commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains and one strain of E. fergusonii (the closest E. coli related species), including seven that we sequenced to completion. Within the ∼18,000 families of orthologous genes, we found ∼2,000 common to all strains. Although recombination rates are much higher than mutation rates, we show, both theoretically and using phylogenetic inference, that this does not obscure the phylogenetic signal, which places the B2 phylogenetic group and one group D strain at the basal position. Based on this phylogeny, we inferred past evolutionary events of gain and loss of genes, identifying functional classes under opposite selection pressures. We found an important adaptive role for metabolism diversification within group B2 and Shigella strains, but identified few or no extraintestinal virulence-specific genes, which could render difficult the development of a vaccine against extraintestinal infections. Genome flux in E. coli is confined to a small number of conserved positions in the chromosome, which most often are not associated with integrases or tRNA genes. Core genes flanking some of these regions show higher rates of recombination, suggesting that a gene, once acquired by a strain, spreads within the species by homologous recombination at the flanking genes. Finally, the genome's long-scale structure of recombination indicates lower recombination rates, but not higher mutation rates, at the terminus of replication. The ensuing effect of background selection and biased gene conversion may thus explain why this region is A+T-rich and shows high sequence divergence but low sequence polymorphism. Overall, despite a very high gene flow, genes co-exist in an organised genome.},

	abstract = {Dolosigranulum pigrum is positively associated with indicators of health in multiple epidemiological studies of human nasal microbiota. Knowledge of the basic biology of D. pigrum is a prerequisite for evaluating its potential for future therapeutic use; however, such data are very limited. To gain insight into D. pigrum’s chromosomal structure, pangenome, and genomic stability, we compared the genomes of 28 D. pigrum strains that were collected across 20 years. Phylogenomic analysis showed closely related strains circulating over this period and closure of 19 genomes revealed highly conserved chromosomal synteny. Gene clusters involved in the mobilome and in defense against mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were enriched in the accessory genome versus the core genome. A systematic analysis for MGEs identified the first candidate D. pigrum prophage and insertion sequence. A systematic analysis for genetic elements that limit the spread of MGEs, including restriction modification (RM), CRISPR-Cas, and deity-named defense systems, revealed strain-level diversity in host defense systems that localized to specific genomic sites, including one RM system hot spot. Analysis of CRISPR spacers pointed to a wealth of MGEs against which D. pigrum defends itself. These results reveal a role for horizontal gene transfer and mobile genetic elements in strain diversification while highlighting that in D. pigrum this occurs within the context of a highly stable chromosomal organization protected by a variety of defense mechanisms.
IMPORTANCE Dolosigranulum pigrum is a candidate beneficial bacterium with potential for future therapeutic use. This is based on its positive associations with characteristics of health in multiple studies of human nasal microbiota across the span of human life. For example, high levels of D. pigrum nasal colonization in adults predicts the absence of Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization. Also, D. pigrum nasal colonization in young children is associated with healthy control groups in studies of middle ear infections. Our analysis of 28 genomes revealed a remarkable stability of D. pigrum strains colonizing people in the United States across a 20-year span. We subsequently identified factors that can influence this stability, including genomic stability, phage predators, the role of MGEs in strain-level variation, and defenses against MGEs. Finally, these D. pigrum strains also lacked predicted virulence factors. Overall, these findings add additional support to the potential for D. pigrum as a therapeutic bacterium.},

We found that transferred genes are concentrated in only {\textasciitilde}1\% of the chromosomal regions (hotspots) in 80 bacterial species. This concentration increases with genome size and with the rate of transfer. Hotspots diversify by rapid gene turnover; their chromosomal distribution depends on local contexts (neighboring core genes), and content in mobile genetic elements. Hotspots concentrate most changes in gene repertoires, reduce the trade-off between genome diversification and organization, and should be treasure troves of strain-specific adaptive genes. Most mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes are in hotspots, but many hotspots lack recognizable mobile genetic elements and exhibit frequent homologous recombination at flanking core genes. Overrepresentation of hotspots with fewer mobile genetic elements in naturally transformable bacteria suggests that homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer are tightly linked in genome evolution.},

Maintaining natural transformation within a species requires that the benefits of transformation outweigh its costs. Although much is known about the distribution of natural transformation among bacterial species, little is known about the degree to which transformation frequencies vary within species. Here we find that there is significant variation in transformation frequency between strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from asymptomatic carriage, and that this variation is not concordant with isolate genetic relatedness. Polymorphism in the signalling system regulating competence is also not causally related to differences in transformation frequency, although this polymorphism does influence the degree of genetic admixture experienced by bacterial strains. These data suggest that bacteria can evolve new transformation frequencies over short evolutionary timescales. This facility may permit cells to balance the potential costs and benefits of transformation by regulating transformation frequency in response to environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Lateral gene transfer (LGT) plays a major role in prokaryote evolution with only a few genes that are resistant to it; yet the nature and magnitude of barriers to lateral transfer are still debated. Here, we implement directed networks to investigate donor–recipient events of recent lateral gene transfer among 657 sequenced prokaryote genomes. For 2,129,548 genes investigated, we detected 446,854 recent lateral gene transfer events through nucleotide pattern analysis. Among these, donor–recipient relationships could be specified through phylogenetic reconstruction for 7\% of the pairs, yielding 32,028 polarized recent gene acquisition events, which constitute the edges of our directed networks. We find that the frequency of recent LGT is linearly correlated both with genome sequence similarity and with proteome similarity of donor–recipient pairs. Genome sequence similarity accounts for 25\% of the variation in gene-transfer frequency, with proteome similarity adding only 1\% to the variability explained. The range of donor–recipient GC content similarity within the network is extremely narrow, with 86\% of the LGTs occurring between donor–recipient pairs having ≤5\% difference in GC content. Hence, genome sequence similarity and GC content similarity are strong barriers to LGT in prokaryotes. But they are not insurmountable, as we detected 1530 recent transfers between distantly related genomes. The directed network revealed that recipient genomes of distant transfers encode proteins of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ; a DNA repair mechanism) far more frequently than the recipient lacking that mechanism. This implicates NHEJ in genes spread across distantly related prokaryotes through bypassing the donor–recipient sequence similarity barrier.},

Here we show that 16S rDNA fragments derived from Illumina-sequenced environmental metagenomes (mitags) are a powerful alternative to 16S rDNA amplicons for investigating the taxonomic diversity and structure of prokaryotic communities. As part of the Tara Oceans global expedition, marine plankton was sampled in three locations, resulting in 29 subsamples for which metagenomes were produced by shotgun Illumina sequencing (ca. 700 Gb). For comparative analyses, a subset of samples was also selected for Roche-454 sequencing using both shotgun (m454tags; 13 metagenomes, ca. 2.4 Gb) and 16S rDNA amplicon (454tags; ca. 0.075 Gb) approaches. Our results indicate that by overcoming PCR biases related to amplification and primer mismatch, mitags may provide more realistic estimates of community richness and evenness than amplicon 454tags. In addition, mitags can capture expected beta diversity patterns. Using mitags is now economically feasible given the dramatic reduction in high-throughput sequencing costs, having the advantage of retrieving simultaneously both taxonomic (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya) and functional information from the same microbial community.},

When using the protein characteristics identified by this algorithm, called ‘features’ in machine learning, our model accurately identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in Gram-negative bacteria. Here we extend our study to Gram-positive bacteria showing that coupling game-theory-identified features with machine learning achieved classification accuracies between 87\% and 90\% for genes encoding resistance to the antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin.

	abstract = {The use of comparative genomics for functional, evolutionary, and epidemiological studies requires methods to classify gene families in terms of occurrence in a given species. These methods usually lack multivariate statistical models to infer the partitions and the optimal number of classes and don’t account for genome organization. We introduce a graph structure to model pangenomes in which nodes represent gene families and edges represent genomic neighborhood. Our method, named PPanGGOLiN, partitions nodes using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on multivariate Bernoulli Mixture Model coupled with a Markov Random Field. This approach takes into account the topology of the graph and the presence/absence of genes in pangenomes to classify gene families into persistent, cloud, and one or several shell partitions. By analyzing the partitioned pangenome graphs of isolate genomes from 439 species and metagenome-assembled genomes from 78 species, we demonstrate that our method is effective in estimating the persistent genome. Interestingly, it shows that the shell genome is a key element to understand genome dynamics, presumably because it reflects how genes present at intermediate frequencies drive adaptation of species, and its proportion in genomes is independent of genome size. The graph-based approach proposed by PPanGGOLiN is useful to depict the overall genomic diversity of thousands of strains in a compact structure and provides an effective basis for very large scale comparative genomics.

Regions of genome plasticity (RGPs) are clusters of genes located in highly variable genomic regions. Most of them arise from HGT and correspond to genomic islands (GIs).

To date, no methods are available to identify GIs using hundreds of genomes to explore their diversity.We present here the panRGP method that predicts RGPs using pangenome graphs made of all available genomes for a given species. It allows the study of thousands of genomes in order to access the diversity of RGPs and to predict spots of insertions. It gave the best predictions when benchmarked along other GI detection tools against a reference dataset. In addition, we illustrated its use on metagenome assembled genomes by redefining the borders of the leuX tRNA hotspot, a well-studied spot of insertion in Escherichia coli. panRPG is a scalable and reliable tool to predict GIs and spots making it an ideal approach for large comparative studies.The methods presented in the current work are available through the following software: https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN.

First, a pan-genome analysis shows that M. tuberculosis is highly conserved with sequenced variation concentrated in PE/PPE/PGRS genes. Second, the platform corroborates 33 genes known to confer resistance and identifies 24 new genetic signatures of AMR. Third, 97 epistatic interactions across 10 resistance classes are revealed.

Here we present the Salmon Microbial Genome Atlas consisting of 211 high-quality bacterial genomes, recovered by cultivation (n = 131) and gut metagenomics (n = 80) from wild and farmed fish both in freshwater and seawater. Bacterial genomes were taxonomically assigned to 14 different orders, including 35 distinctive genera and 29 previously undescribed species. Using metatranscriptomics, we functionally characterized key bacterial populations, across five phyla, in the salmon gut. This included the ability to degrade diet-derived fibres and release vitamins and other exometabolites with known beneficial effects, which was supported by genome-scale metabolic modelling and in vitro cultivation of selected bacterial species coupled with untargeted metabolomic studies.

	abstract = {Analysis toolkits for shotgun metagenomic data achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation. Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters.We introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.The binary is freely available for non-commercial users at www.enterome.com/downloads.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes) and IBD (1635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes.

While this expanded diversity can provide novel insights into microbial population structure, most tools available for core-genome estimation are sensitive to genome completeness. Consequently, a major portion of the huge phylogenetic diversity uncovered by environmental genomic approaches remains excluded from such analyses. We present mOTUpan, a novel iterative Bayesian method for computing the core genome for sets of genomes of highly diverse completeness range. The likelihood for each gene cluster to belong to core or accessory genome is estimated by computing the probability of its presence/absence pattern in the target genome set. The core-genome prediction is computationally efficient and can be scaled up to thousands of genomes. It has shown comparable estimates to state-of-the-art tools Roary and PPanGGOLiN for high-quality genomes and is capable of using genomes at lower completeness thresholds. mOTUpan wraps a bootstrapping procedure to estimate the quality of a specific core-genome prediction, as the accuracy of each run will depend on the specific completeness distribution and the number of genomes in the dataset under scrutiny. mOTUpan is implemented in the mOTUlizer software package, and available at github.com/moritzbuck/mOTUlizer, under GPL 3.0 license.},

Advances in whole genome sequencing technologies have led to a vast expansion in the amount of bacterial genomes deposited in public databases. There is a pressing need for software solutions which are able to cluster, catalogue and characterise genes, or other features, in increasingly large genomic datasets.Here we present a pangenomics toolbox, PIRATE (Pangenome Iterative Refinement and Threshold Evaluation), which identifies and classifies orthologous gene families in bacterial pangenomes over a wide range of sequence similarity thresholds. PIRATE builds upon recent scalable software developments to allow for the rapid interrogation of thousands of isolates. PIRATE clusters genes (or other annotated features) over a wide range of amino acid or nucleotide identity thresholds and uses the clustering information to rapidly identify paralogous gene families and putative fission/fusion events. Furthermore, PIRATE orders the pangenome using a directed graph, provides a measure of allelic variation, and estimates sequence divergence for each gene family.We demonstrate that PIRATE scales linearly with both number of samples and computation resources, allowing for analysis of large genomic datasets, and compares favorably to other popular tools. PIRATE provides a robust framework for analysing bacterial pangenomes, from largely clonal to panmictic species.},

It can cluster homologous gene families using the bidirectional best-hit, COGtriangles, or OrthoMCL clustering algorithms. Clustering stringency can be adjusted by scanning the domain composition of proteins using the HMMER3 package, by imposing desired pairwise alignment coverage cutoffs, or by selecting only syntenic genes. The resulting homologous gene families can be made even more robust by computing consensus clusters from those generated by any combination of the clustering algorithms and filtering criteria. Auxiliary scripts make the construction, interrogation, and graphical display of core genome and pangenome sets easy to perform. Exponential and binomial mixture models can be fitted to the data to estimate theoretical core genome and pangenome sizes, and high-quality graphics can be generated. Furthermore, pangenome trees can be easily computed and basic comparative genomics performed to identify lineage-specific genes or gene family expansions. The software is designed to take advantage of modern multiprocessor personal computers as well as computer clusters to parallelize time-consuming tasks. To demonstrate some of these capabilities, we survey a set of 50 Streptococcus genomes annotated in the Orthologous Matrix (OMA) browser as a benchmark case.

	abstract = {A long-standing limitation in comparative genomic studies is the dependency on a reference genome, which hinders the spectrum of genetic diversity that can be identified across a population of organisms. This is especially true in the microbial world where genome architectures can significantly vary. There is therefore a need for computational methods that can simultaneously analyze the architectures of multiple genomes without introducing bias from a reference.In this article, we present Ptolemy: a novel method for studying the diversity of genome architectures—such as structural variation and pan-genomes—across a collection of microbial assemblies without the need of a reference. Ptolemy is a ‘top-down’ approach to compare whole genome assemblies. Genomes are represented as labeled multi-directed graphs—known as quivers—which are then merged into a single, canonical quiver by identifying ‘gene anchors’ via synteny analysis. The canonical quiver represents an approximate, structural alignment of all genomes in a given collection encoding structural variation across (sub-) populations within the collection. We highlight various applications of Ptolemy by analyzing structural variation and the pan-genomes of different datasets composing of Mycobacterium, Saccharomyces, Escherichia and Shigella species. Our results show that Ptolemy is flexible and can handle both conserved and highly dynamic genome architectures. Ptolemy is user-friendly—requires only FASTA-formatted assembly along with a corresponding GFF-formatted file—and resource-friendly—can align 24 genomes in ∼10 mins with four CPUs and \&lt;2 GB of RAM.Github: https://github.com/AbeelLab/ptolemySupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Reference-based approaches are thus blind to the dynamics of the accessory genome, as well as variation within gene order and copy number. With the widespread usage of long-read sequencing, the number of high-quality, complete genome assemblies has increased dramatically. In addition to pangenomic approaches that focus on the variation in the sets of genes present in different genomes, complete assemblies allow investigations of the evolution of genome structure and gene order. This latter problem, however, is computationally demanding with few tools available that shed light on these dynamics. Here, we present PanGraph, a Julia-based library and command line interface for aligning whole genomes into a graph. Each genome is represented as a path along vertices, which in turn encapsulate homologous multiple sequence alignments.

We demonstrate the use of Piggy on large datasets of clinically important lineages of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.For S. aureus, we show that highly divergent (switched) IGRs are associated with differences in gene expression and we establish a multilocus reference database of IGR alleles (igMLST; implemented in BIGSdb).},

Interactions take place at different scales-local for gene expression, global for replication-and lead to the differentiation of the chromosome into organizational units such as operons, replichores, or macrodomains. These processes are intermingled in the cell and create complex higher-level organizational features that are adaptive because they favor the interplay between the processes. The surprising result of selection for genome organization is that gene repertoires change much more quickly than chromosomal structure. Comparative genomics and experimental genomic manipulations are untangling the different cellular and evolutionary mechanisms causing such resilience to change.

	abstract = {The determination of complete genome sequences provides us with an opportunity to describe and analyze evolution at the comprehensive level of genomes. Here we compare nine genomes with respect to their protein coding genes at two levels: (i) we compare genomes as “bags of genes” and measure the fraction of orthologs shared between genomes and (ii) we quantify correlations between genes with respect to their relative positions in genomes. Distances between the genomes are related to their divergence times, measured as the number of amino acid substitutions per site in a set of 34 orthologous genes that are shared among all the genomes compared. We establish a hierarchy of rates at which genomes have changed during evolution. Protein sequence identity is the most conserved, followed by the complement of genes within the genome. Next is the degree of conservation of the order of genes, whereas gene regulation appears to evolve at the highest rate. Finally, we show that some genomes are more highly organized than others: they show a higher degree of the clustering of genes that have orthologs in other genomes.},

Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of “recent” paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

It remains unknown whether genetic variation in serotype 1 strains modulates tropism into cerebrospinal fluid to cause central nervous system (CNS) infections, particularly meningitis. Here, we address this question through a large-scale linear mixed model genome-wide association study of 909 African pneumococcal serotype 1 isolates collected from CNS and non-CNS human samples. By controlling for host age, geography, and strain population structure, we identify genome-wide statistically significant genotype-phenotype associations in surface-exposed choline-binding (P = 5.00 × 10−08) and helicase proteins (P = 1.32 × 10−06) important for invasion, immune evasion and pneumococcal tropism to CNS. The small effect sizes and negligible heritability indicated that causation of CNS infection requires multiple genetic and other factors reflecting a complex and polygenic aetiology. Our findings suggest that certain pathogen genetic variation modulate pneumococcal survival and tropism to CNS tissue, and therefore, virulence for meningitis.},

We explore connections between metagenomic read assignment and the quantification of transcripts from RNA-Seq data in order to develop novel methods for rapid and accurate quantification of metagenomic strains.We find that the recent idea of pseudoalignment introduced in the RNA-Seq context is highly applicable in the metagenomics setting. When coupled with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, reads can be assigned far more accurately and quickly than is currently possible with state of the art software, making it possible and practical for the first time to analyze abundances of individual genomes in metagenomics projects.Pipeline and analysis code can be downloaded from http://github.com/pachterlab/metakallisto},

The data structure has a single parameter k, is straightforward to implement and is tractable for large genomes with high sequencing depth. It also enables representation of multiple samples simultaneously to facilitate comparison. However, unlike the string graph, a de Bruijn graph does not retain long range information that is inherent in the read data. For this reason, applications that rely on de Bruijn graphs can produce sub-optimal results given their input data.We present a novel assembly graph data structure: the Linked de Bruijn Graph (LdBG). Constructed by adding annotations on top of a de Bruijn graph, it stores long range connectivity information through the graph. We show that with error-free data it is possible to losslessly store and recover sequence from a Linked de Bruijn graph. With assembly simulations we demonstrate that the LdBG data structure outperforms both our de Bruijn graph and the String Graph Assembler (SGA). Finally we apply the LdBG to Klebsiella pneumoniae short read data to make large (12 kbp) variant calls, which we validate using PacBio sequencing data, and to characterize the genomic context of drug-resistance genes.Linked de Bruijn Graphs and associated algorithms are implemented as part of McCortex, which is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/mcveanlab/mccortex.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Recently, alignment-free methods based on k-mer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are sometimes hard to interpret. Here we introduce DBGWAS, an extended k-mer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with distinct phenotypes. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes, identified by the association model, into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. In particular, it does not require prior annotation or reference genomes. It produces subgraphs representing phenotype-associated genetic variants such as local polymorphisms and mobile genetic elements (MGE). It offers a graphical framework which helps interpret GWAS results. Importantly it is also computationally efficient—experiments took one hour and a half on average. We validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa—along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature.

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technology is generating a wealth of highly similar genome sequences for many species, paving the way for a transition from single-genome to pan-genome analyses. Accordingly, genomics research is going to switch from reference-centric to pan-genomic approaches. We define the pan-genome as a comprehensive representation of multiple annotated genomes, facilitating analyses on the similarity and divergence of the constituent genomes at the nucleotide, gene and genome structure level. Current pan-genomic approaches do not thoroughly address scalability, functionality and usability.We introduce a generalized De Bruijn graph as a pan-genome representation, as well as an online algorithm to construct it. This representation is stored in a Neo4j graph database, which makes our approach scalable to large eukaryotic genomes. Besides the construction algorithm, our software package, called PanTools, currently provides functionality for annotating pan-genomes, adding sequences, grouping genes, retrieving gene sequences or genomic regions, reconstructing genomes and comparing and querying pan-genomes. We demonstrate the performance of the tool using datasets of 62 E. coli genomes, 93 yeast genomes and 19 Arabidopsis thaliana genomes.The Java implementation of PanTools is publicly available at http://www.bif.wur.nl.sandra.smit@wur.nl},

	abstract = {Motivation: Genomics is expanding from a single reference per species paradigm into a more comprehensive pan-genome approach that analyzes multiple individuals together. A compressed de Bruijn graph is a sophisticated data structure for representing the genomes of entire populations. It robustly encodes shared segments, simple single-nucleotide polymorphisms and complex structural variations far beyond what can be represented in a collection of linear sequences alone. Results: We explore deep topological relationships between suffix trees and compressed de Bruijn graphs and introduce an algorithm, splitMEM, that directly constructs the compressed de Bruijn graph in time and space linear to the total number of genomes for a given maximum genome size. We introduce suffix skips to traverse several suffix links simultaneously and use them to efficiently decompose maximal exact matches into graph nodes. We demonstrate the utility of splitMEM by analyzing the nine-strain pan-genome of Bacillus anthracis and up to 62 strains of Escherichia coli , revealing their core-genome properties.

	abstract = {Background Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging problem. Effects of recombination including rearrangement, segmental duplication, gain, and loss can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among closely related organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe a new method to align two or more genomes that have undergone rearrangements due to recombination and substantial amounts of segmental gain and loss (flux). We demonstrate that the new method can accurately align regions conserved in some, but not all, of the genomes, an important case not handled by our previous work. The method uses a novel alignment objective score called a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score, which facilitates accurate detection of rearrangement breakpoints when genomes have unequal gene content. We also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering method to remove erroneous alignments of unrelated sequences, which are commonly observed in other genome alignment methods. We describe new metrics for quantifying genome alignment accuracy which measure the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and indel predictions. The new genome alignment algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in situations where genomes have undergone biologically feasible amounts of genome rearrangement, segmental gain and loss. We apply the new algorithm to a set of 23 genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella. Analysis of whole-genome multiple alignments allows us to extend the previously defined concepts of core- and pan-genomes to include not only annotated genes, but also non-coding regions with potential regulatory roles. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated core-genome of 2.46Mbp conserved among all taxa and a pan-genome of 15.2Mbp. We document substantial population-level variability among these organisms driven by segmental gain and loss. Interestingly, much variability lies in intergenic regions, suggesting that the Enterobacteriacae may exhibit regulatory divergence. Conclusions The multiple genome alignments generated by our software provide a platform for comparative genomic and population genomic studies. Free, open-source software implementing the described genome alignment approach is available from http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have decreased both time span and cost for sequencing the whole bacterial genome. High-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to the generation of enormous data concerning microbial populations publically available across various repositories. As a consequence, it has become possible to study and compare the genomes of different bacterial strains within a species or genus in terms of evolution, ecology and diversity. Studying the pan-genome provides insights into deciphering microevolution, global composition and diversity in virulence and pathogenesis of a species. It can also assist in identifying drug targets and proposing vaccine candidates. The effective analysis of these large genome datasets necessitates the development of robust tools. Current methods to develop pan-genome do not support direct input of raw reads from the sequencer machine but require preprocessing of reads as an assembled proteinProtein/gene sequence file or the binary matrix of orthologous genes/proteins. We have designed an easy-to-use integrated pipeline, NGSPanPipe, which can directly identify the pan-genome from short reads. The output from the pipeline is compatible with other pan-genome analysis tools. We evaluated our pipeline with other methods for developing pan-genome, i.e. reference-based assembly and de novode novo assembly using simulated reads of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The single script pipeline (pipeline.pl) is applicable for all bacterial strains.

Soon after these breakthroughs, an exponential rate of genome sequencing was established, with a doubling time of approximately 20 months for bacteria and approximately 34 months for archaea. Comparative analysis of the hundreds of sequenced bacterial and dozens of archaeal genomes leads to several generalizations on the principles of genome organization and evolution. A crucial finding that enables functional characterization of the sequenced genomes and evolutionary reconstruction is that the majority of archaeal and bacterial genes have conserved orthologs in other, often, distant organisms. However, comparative genomics also shows that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a dominant force of prokaryotic evolution, along with the loss of genetic material resulting in genome contraction. A crucial component of the prokaryotic world is the mobilome, the enormous collection of viruses, plasmids and other selfish elements, which are in constant exchange with more stable chromosomes and serve as HGT vehicles. Thus, the prokaryotic genome space is a tightly connected, although compartmentalized, network, a novel notion that undermines the ‘Tree of Life’ model of evolution and requires a new conceptual framework and tools for the study of prokaryotic evolution.},

	abstract = {Due to a constant evolutionary arms race, archaea and bacteria have evolved an abundance and diversity of immune responses to protect themselves against phages. Since the discovery and application of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems, numerous novel candidates for immune systems have been identified. Previous approaches to identifying these new immune systems rely on hidden Markov model (HMM)–based homolog searches or use labor-intensive and costly wet-lab experiments. To aid in finding and classifying immune systems genomes, we use machine learning to classify already known immune system proteins and discover potential candidates in the genome. Neural networks have shown promising results in classifying and predicting protein functionality in recent years. However, these methods often operate under the closed-world assumption, where it is presumed that all potential outcomes or classes are already known and included in the training dataset. This assumption does not always hold true in real-world scenarios, such as in genomics, where new samples can emerge that were not previously accounted for in the training phase.In this work, we explore neural networks for immune protein classification, deal with different methods for rejecting unrelated proteins in a genome-wide search, and establish a benchmark. Then, we optimize our approach for accuracy. Based on this, we develop an algorithm called Deepdefense to predict immune cassette classes based on a genome. This design facilitates the differentiation between immune system–related and unrelated proteins by analyzing variations in model-predicted confidence values, aiding in the identification of both known and potentially novel immune system proteins. Finally, we test our approach for detecting immune systems in the genome against an HMM-based method.Deepdefense can automatically detect genes and define cassette annotations and classifications using 2 model classifications. This is achieved by creating an optimized deep learning model to annotate immune systems, in combination with calibration methods, and a second model to enable the scanning of an entire genome.},

	abstract = {CRISPR–Cas are adaptive immune systems that degrade foreign genetic elements in archaea and bacteria. In carrying out their immune functions, CRISPR–Cas systems heavily rely on RNA components. These CRISPR (cr) RNAs are repeat-spacer units that are produced by processing of pre-crRNA, the transcript of CRISPR arrays, and guide Cas protein(s) to the cognate invading nucleic acids, enabling their destruction. Several bioinformatics tools have been developed to detect CRISPR arrays based solely on DNA sequences, but all these tools employ the same strategy of looking for repetitive patterns, which might correspond to CRISPR array repeats. The identified patterns are evaluated using a fixed, built-in scoring function, and arrays exceeding a cut-off value are reported. Here, we instead introduce a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to detect and differentiate true CRISPR arrays from false ones based on several features. Our CRISPR detection tool, CRISPRidentify, performs three steps: detection, feature extraction and classification based on manually curated sets of positive and negative examples of CRISPR arrays. The identified CRISPR arrays are then reported to the user accompanied by detailed annotation. We demonstrate that our approach identifies not only previously detected CRISPR arrays, but also CRISPR array candidates not detected by other tools. Compared to other methods, our tool has a drastically reduced false positive rate. In contrast to the existing tools, our approach not only provides the user with the basic statistics on the identified CRISPR arrays but also produces a certainty score as a practical measure of the likelihood that a given genomic region is a CRISPR array.},

Specific prediction methods find crRNA-encoding loci in nearly half of sequenced bacterial, and three quarters of archaeal, species. These Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) arrays consist of repeat elements alternating with specific spacers. Generally one strand is transcribed, producing long pre-crRNAs, which are processed to short crRNAs that base pair with invading nucleic acids to facilitate their destruction. No current software for the discovery of CRISPR loci predicts the direction of crRNA transcription. Results: We have developed an algorithm that accurately predicts the strand of the resulting crRNAs. The method uses as input CRISPR repeat predictions. CRISPRDirection uses parameters that are calculated from the CRISPR repeat predictions and flanking sequences, which are combined by weighted voting. The prediction may use prior coding sequence annotation but this is not required. CRISPRDirection correctly predicted the orientation of 94\% of a reference set of arrays.

	abstract = {The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system in many archaea and bacteria, which provides resistance against invading genetic elements. The first phase of CRISPR-Cas immunity is called adaptation, in which small DNA fragments are excised from genetic elements and are inserted into a CRISPR array generally adjacent to its so called leader sequence at one end of the array. It has been shown that transcription initiation and adaptation signals of the CRISPR array are located within the leader. However, apart from promoters, there is very little knowledge of sequence or structural motifs or their possible functions. Leader properties have mainly been characterized through transcriptional initiation data from single organisms but large-scale characterization of leaders has remained challenging due to their low level of sequence conservation.We developed a method to successfully detect leader sequences by focusing on the consensus repeat of the adjacent CRISPR array and weak upstream conservation signals. We applied our tool to the analysis of a comprehensive genomic database and identified several characteristic properties of leader sequences specific to archaea and bacteria, ranging from distinctive sizes to preferential indel localization. CRISPRleader provides a full annotation of the CRISPR array, its strand orientation as well as conserved core leader boundaries that can be uploaded to any genome browser.

	abstract = {Motivation: The discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems almost 20 years ago rapidly changed our perception of the bacterial and archaeal immune systems. CRISPR loci consist of several repetitive DNA sequences called repeats, inter-spaced by stretches of variable length sequences called spacers. This CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into multiple mature RNA species (crRNAs). A single crRNA is integrated into an interference complex, together with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade invading nucleic acids. Although existing bioinformatics tools can recognize CRISPR loci by their characteristic repeat-spacer architecture, they generally output CRISPR arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus do not determine the strand from which crRNAs are processed. Knowledge of the correct orientation is crucial for many tasks, including the classification of CRISPR conservation, the detection of leader regions, the identification of target sites (protospacers) on invading genetic elements and the characterization of protospacer-adjacent motifs.Results: We present a fast and accurate tool to determine the crRNA-encoding strand at CRISPR loci by predicting the correct orientation of repeats based on an advanced machine learning approach. Both the repeat sequence and mutation information were encoded and processed by an efficient graph kernel to learn higher-order correlations. The model was trained and tested on curated data comprising \&gt;4500 CRISPRs and yielded a remarkable performance of 0.95 AUC ROC (area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic). In addition, we show that accurate orientation information greatly improved detection of conserved repeat sequence families and structure motifs. We integrated CRISPRstrand predictions into our CRISPRmap web server of CRISPR conservation and updated the latter to version 2.0.Availability: CRISPRmap and CRISPRstrand are available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CRISPRmap.Contact: backofen@informatik.uni-freiburg.deSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The discovery and application of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems has spurred recent interest in the identification and classification of new types of defence systems. Many new defence systems have recently been reported but there is a lack of accessible tools available to identify homologs of these systems in different genomes. Here, we report the Prokaryotic Antiviral Defence LOCator (PADLOC), a flexible and scalable open-source tool for defence system identification. With PADLOC, defence system genes are identified using HMM-based homologue searches, followed by validation of system completeness using gene presence/absence and synteny criteria specified by customisable system classifications. We show that PADLOC identifies defence systems with high accuracy and sensitivity. Our modular approach to organising the HMMs and system classifications allows additional defence systems to be easily integrated into the PADLOC database. To demonstrate application of PADLOC to biological questions, we used PADLOC to identify six new subtypes of known defence systems and a putative novel defence system comprised of a helicase, methylase and ATPase.

Here we performed a large-scale in-depth analysis of the defensomes of 7759 high-quality bacterial population genomes reconstructed from soil, marine, and human gut environments. We observed a wide variation in the frequency and nature of the defensome among large phyla, which correlated with lifestyle, genome size, habitat, and geographic background. The defensome’s genetic mobility, its clustering in defense islands, and genetic variability was found to be system-specific and shaped by the bacterial environment. Hence, our results provide a detailed picture of the multiple immune barriers present in environmentally distinct bacterial communities and set the stage for subsequent identification of novel and ingenious strategies of diversification among uncultivated microbes.},

	abstract = {Phages are ubiquitous in nature, and bacteria with very different genomics, metabolisms, and lifestyles are subjected to their predation. Yet, the defence systems that allow bacteria to resist their phages have rarely been explored experimentally outside a very limited number of model organisms. Actinobacteria (Actinomycetota) are a phylum of GC-rich Gram-positive bacteria, which often produce an important diversity of secondary metabolites. Despite being ubiquitous in a wide range of environments, from soil to fresh and sea water but also the gut microbiome, relatively little is known about the anti-phage arsenal of Actinobacteria. In this work, we used DefenseFinder to systematically detect 131 anti-phage defence systems in 22803 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes, among which are 2253 Actinobacteria of more than 700 species. We show that, like other bacteria, Actinobacteria encode many diverse anti-phage systems that are often encoded on mobile genetic elements. We further demonstrate that most detected defence systems are absent or rarer in Actinobacteria than in other bacteria, while a few rare systems are enriched (notably gp29-gp30 and Wadjet). We characterize the spatial distribution of anti-phage systems on \&\#160;\&\#160;Streptomyces\&\#160;\&\#160; chromosomes and show that some defence systems (e.g. RM systems) tend to be encoded in the core region, while others (e.g. Lamassu and Wadjet) are enriched towards the extremities. Overall, our results suggest that Actinobacteria might be a source of novel anti-phage systems and provide clues to characterize mechanistic aspects of known anti-phage systems.},

Recent studies have revealed that the immune arsenal of bacteria against bacteriophages is much more diverse than previously envisioned. These discoveries have led to seemingly contradictory observations: on one hand, individual microorganisms often encode multiple distinct defence systems, some of which are acquired by horizontal gene transfer, alluding to their fitness benefit. On the other hand, defence systems are frequently lost from prokaryotic genomes on short evolutionary time scales, suggesting that they impose a fitness cost. In this Perspective article, we present the ‘pan-immune system’ model in which we suggest that, although a single strain cannot carry all possible defence systems owing to their burden on fitness, it can employ horizontal gene transfer to access immune defence mechanisms encoded by closely related strains. Thus, the ‘effective’ immune system is not the one encoded by the genome of a single microorganism but rather by its pan-genome, comprising the sum of all immune systems available for a microorganism to horizontally acquire and use.},

We analyzed the distribution of defense genes and typical mobilome components (such as viral and transposon genes) in bacterial and archaeal genomes and demonstrated statistically significant clustering of antivirus defense systems and mobile genes and elements in genomic islands. The defense islands are enriched in putative operons and contain numerous overrepresented gene families. A detailed sequence analysis of the proteins encoded by genes in these families shows that many of them are diverged variants of known defense system components, whereas others show features, such as characteristic operonic organization, that are suggestive of novel defense systems. Thus, genomic islands provide abundant material for the experimental study of bacterial and archaeal antivirus defense. Except for the CRISPR-Cas systems, different classes of defense systems, in particular toxin-antitoxin and restriction-modification systems, show nonrandom clustering in defense islands. It remains unclear to what extent these associations reflect functional cooperation between different defense systems and to what extent the islands are genomic "sinks" that accumulate diverse nonessential genes, particularly those acquired via horizontal gene transfer. The characteristics of defense islands resemble those of mobilome islands. Defense and mobilome genes are nonrandomly associated in islands, suggesting nonadaptive evolution of the islands via a preferential attachment-like mechanism underpinned by the addictive properties of defense systems such as toxins-antitoxins and an important role of horizontal mobility in the evolution of these islands.},

Candidate defense systems were systematically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage systems and one antiplasmid system that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders.

	abstract = {Bacteria have evolved a wide array of mechanisms that allow them to eliminate phage infection. ‘Abortive infection’ (abi) systems are an expanding category of such mechanisms, defined as those which induce programmed cell death (or dormancy) upon infection, and thus halt phage propagation within a bacterial population. This definition entails two requirements – a phenotypic observation (cell death upon infection), and a mechanistic determination of its sources (system-induced death). The phenotypic and mechanistic aspects of abi are often implicitly assumed to be tightly linked, and studies regularly tend to establish one and deduce the other. However, recent evidence points to a complicated relationship between the mechanism of defense and the phenotype observed upon infection. We argue that rather than viewing the abi phenotype as an inherent quality of a set of defense systems, it should be more appropriately thought of as an attribute of interactions between specific phages and bacteria under given conditions. Consequently, we also point to potential pitfalls in the prevailing methods for ascertaining the abi phenotype. Overall, we propose an alternative framework for parsing interactions between attacking phages and defending bacteria.},

Abortive infections constitute model systems for the study of host-parasite interactions, but until the 1980s such studies were confined largely to descriptions of a plethora of physiological dysfunctions. The use of cloning vectors containing the genes involved in the exclusion phenomena have helped to reduce the complexity of the abortive infection while maintaining many of its natural biological characteristics. The use of these vectors has also led to the development of a convenient assay for the identification of the targets of an exclusion system. Plasmids expressing a target gene are frequently found to be unable to transform a cell that contains the exclusion system. This article focuses on two classic abortive infections, the exclusion of T4 rII mutants by lambda rex+ lysogens and of wild-type T7 by cells containing the plasmid F. In addition, some less well understood phage exclusion systems are described, since they share a number of features with the T4 and T7 systems. Elucidation of the normal functions of the components involved in some abortive infections is also helping our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and it seems likely that one or more of these model systems will soon be fully described.},

	abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are a family of DNA direct repeats found in many prokaryotic genomes. Repeats of 21–37 bp typically show weak dyad symmetry and are separated by regularly sized, nonrepetitive spacer sequences. Four CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families, designated Cas1 to Cas4, are strictly associated with CRISPR elements and always occur near a repeat cluster. Some spacers originate from mobile genetic elements and are thought to confer “immunity” against the elements that harbor these sequences. In the present study, we have systematically investigated uncharacterized proteins encoded in the vicinity of these CRISPRs and found many additional protein families that are strictly associated with CRISPR loci across multiple prokaryotic species. Multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models have been built for 45 Cas protein families. These models identify family members with high sensitivity and selectivity and classify key regulators of development, DevR and DevS, in Myxococcus xanthus as Cas proteins. These identifications show that CRISPR/cas gene regions can be quite large, with up to 20 different, tandem-arranged cas genes next to a repeat cluster or filling the region between two repeat clusters. Distinctive subsets of the collection of Cas proteins recur in phylogenetically distant species and correlate with characteristic repeat periodicity. The analyses presented here support initial proposals of mobility of these units, along with the likelihood that loci of different subtypes interact with one another as well as with host cell defensive, replicative, and regulatory systems. It is evident from this analysis that CRISPR/cas loci are larger, more complex, and more heterogeneous than previously appreciated.},

In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.},

Analysis of these genomes and those available in databases showed that the S. agalactiae species can be described by a pan-genome consisting of a core genome shared by all isolates, accounting for approximately 80\% of any single genome, plus a dispensable genome consisting of partially shared and strain-specific genes.

	abstract = {Processes of molecular innovation require tinkering and shifting in the function of existing genes. How this occurs in terms of molecular evolution at long evolutionary scales remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse the natural history of a vast group of membrane-associated molecular systems in Bacteria and Archaea—the type IV filament (TFF) superfamily—that diversified in systems involved in flagellar or twitching motility, adhesion, protein secretion, and DNA uptake. The phylogeny of the thousands of detected systems suggests they may have been present in the last universal common ancestor. From there, two lineages—a bacterial and an archaeal—diversified by multiple gene duplications, gene fissions and deletions, and accretion of novel components. Surprisingly, we find that the ‘tight adherence’ (Tad) systems originated from the interkingdom transfer from Archaea to Bacteria of a system resembling the ‘EppA-dependent’ (Epd) pilus and were associated with the acquisition of a secretin. The phylogeny and content of ancestral systems suggest that initial bacterial pili were engaged in cell motility and/or DNA uptake. In contrast, specialised protein secretion systems arose several times independently and much later in natural history. The functional diversification of the TFF superfamily was accompanied by genetic rearrangements with implications for genetic regulation and horizontal gene transfer: systems encoded in fewer loci were more frequently exchanged between taxa. This may have contributed to their rapid evolution and spread across Bacteria and Archaea. Hence, the evolutionary history of the superfamily reveals an impressive catalogue of molecular evolution mechanisms that resulted in remarkable functional innovation and specialisation from a relatively small set of components.},

However, the genomes of Bacteroidota with T6SSs appear to lack genes encoding homologs of canonical MC components. Here, we identify five genes in Bacteroides fragilis (tssNQOPR) that are essential for T6SS function and encode a Bacteroidota-specific MC. We purify this complex, reveal its dimensions using electron microscopy, and identify a protein-protein interaction network underlying the assembly of the MC including the stoichiometry of the five TssNQOPR components. Protein TssN mediates the connection between the Bacteroidota MC and the conserved baseplate. Although MC gene content and organization varies across the phylum Bacteroidota, no MC homologs are detected outside of T6SS loci, suggesting ancient co-option and functional convergence with the non-homologous MC of Pseudomonadota.},

These systems were extensively studied in some model bacteria, but the characterisation of their diversity has lagged behind due to lack of standard annotation tools. We built online and standalone computational tools to accurately predict protein secretion systems and related appendages in bacteria with LPS-containing outer membranes. They consist of models describing the systems’ components and genetic organization to be used with MacSyFinder to search for T1SS-T6SS, T9SS, flagella, Type IV pili and Tad pili. We identified {\textasciitilde}10,000 candidate systems in bacterial genomes, where T1SS and T5SS were by far the most abundant and widespread. All these data are made available in a public database. The recently described T6SSiii and T9SS were restricted to Bacteroidetes, and T6SSii to Francisella. The T2SS, T3SS, and T4SS were frequently encoded in single-copy in one locus, whereas most T1SS were encoded in two loci. The secretion systems of diderm Firmicutes were similar to those found in other diderms. Novel systems may remain to be discovered, since some clades of environmental bacteria lacked all known protein secretion systems. Our models can be fully customized, which should facilitate the identification of novel systems.},

The organization and function of integrative and conjugative elements (ICE), even if they are more abundant, was only studied in a few model systems. Comparative genomics of ICE has been precluded by the difficulty in finding and delimiting these elements. Here, we present the results of a method that circumvents these problems by requiring only the identification of the conjugation genes and the species’ pan-genome. We delimited 200 ICEs and this allowed the first large-scale characterization of these elements. We quantified the presence in ICEs of a wide set of functions associated with the biology of mobile genetic elements, including some that are typically associated with plasmids, such as partition and replication. Protein sequence similarity networks and phylogenetic analyses revealed that ICEs are structured in functional modules. Integrases and conjugation systems have different evolutionary histories, even if the gene repertoires of ICEs can be grouped in function of conjugation types. Our characterization of the composition and organization of ICEs paves the way for future functional and evolutionary analyses of their cargo genes, composed of a majority of unknown function genes.},

	abstract = {Motivation Biologists often wish to use their knowledge on a few experimental models of a given molecular system to identify homologs in genomic data. We developed a generic tool for this purpose. Results Macromolecular System Finder (MacSyFinder) provides a flexible framework to model the properties of molecular systems (cellular machinery or pathway) including their components, evolutionary associations with other systems and genetic architecture. Modelled features also include functional analogs, and the multiple uses of a same component by different systems. Models are used to search for molecular systems in complete genomes or in unstructured data like metagenomes. The components of the systems are searched by sequence similarity using Hidden Markov model (HMM) protein profiles. The assignment of hits to a given system is decided based on compliance with the content and organization of the system model. A graphical interface, MacSyView, facilitates the analysis of the results by showing overviews of component content and genomic context. To exemplify the use of MacSyFinder we built models to detect and class CRISPR-Cas systems following a previously established classification. We show that MacSyFinder allows to easily define an accurate “Cas-finder” using publicly available protein profiles. Availability and Implementation MacSyFinder is a standalone application implemented in Python. It requires Python 2.7, Hmmer and makeblastdb (version 2.2.28 or higher). It is freely available with its source code under a GPLv3 license at https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsyfinder. It is compatible with all platforms supporting Python and Hmmer/makeblastdb. The “Cas-finder” (models and HMM profiles) is distributed as a compressed tarball archive as Supporting Information.},

The identification of effectors is a crucial step in understanding the mechanisms of bacterial pathogenicity, but this remains a major challenge. In this study, we used the full-length embedding features generated by six pre-trained protein language models to train classifiers predicting T4SEs and compared their performance. We integrated three modules into a model called T4SEpp. The first module searched for full-length homologs of known T4SEs, signal sequences, and effector domains; the second module fine-tuned a machine learning model using data for a signal sequence feature; and the third module used the three best-performing pre-trained protein language models. T4SEpp outperformed other state-of-the-art (SOTA) software tools, achieving ∼0.98 accuracy at a high specificity of ∼0.99, based on the assessment of an independent validation dataset. T4SEpp predicted 13 T4SEs from Helicobacter pylori, including the well-known CagA and 12 other potential ones, among which eleven could potentially interact with human proteins. This suggests that these potential T4SEs may be associated with the pathogenicity of H. pylori. Overall, T4SEpp provides a better solution to assist in the identification of bacterial T4SEs and facilitates studies of bacterial pathogenicity.

It also degrades linear double-stranded DNA, protecting the bacteria from phages and extraneous chromosomal DNA. The RecBCD enzyme is, however, regulated by a cis-acting DNA sequence known as Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) that activates its recombination-promoting functions. Interaction with Chi causes an attenuation of the RecBCD enzyme's vigorous nuclease activity, switches the polarity of the attenuated nuclease activity to the 5′ strand, changes the operation of its motor subunits, and instructs the enzyme to begin loading the RecA protein onto the resultant Chi-containing single-stranded DNA. This enzyme is a prototypical example of a molecular machine: the protein architecture incorporates several autonomous functional domains that interact with each other to produce a complex, sequence-regulated, DNA-processing machine. In this review, we discuss the biochemical mechanism of the RecBCD enzyme with particular emphasis on new developments relating to the enzyme's structure and DNA translocation mechanism.},

This paper studies the applications, advantages, and limitations of the Hidden Markov Model across various fields. The study suggests that with accurate calculation and precise input, the Hidden Markov Model will work wonderfully well with high accuracy, though its application areas are limited. Besides this, the main drawback of the model is its computational expensiveness and probabilistic results. Furthermore, the work also suggests a scope for further exploring the applications of Hidden Markov Model in enhancing the security of a nation.},

	abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs) are widely employed in various bioinformatics applications to identify similarities between biological sequences, such as DNA or protein sequences. In pHMMs, sequences are represented as graph structures, where states and edges capture modifications (i.e., insertions, deletions, and substitutions) by assigning probabilities to them. These probabilities are subsequently used to compute the similarity score between a sequence and a pHMM graph. The Baum-Welch algorithm, a prevalent and highly accurate method, utilizes these probabilities to optimize and compute similarity scores. Accurate computation of these probabilities is essential for the correct identification of sequence similarities. However, the Baum-Welch algorithm is computationally intensive, and existing solutions offer either software-only or hardware-only approaches with fixed pHMM designs. When we analyze state-of-the-art works, we identify an urgent need for a flexible, high-performance, and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design to address the major inefficiencies in the Baum-Welch algorithm for pHMMs.We introduce ApHMM, the first flexible acceleration framework designed to significantly reduce both computational and energy overheads associated with the Baum-Welch algorithm for pHMMs. ApHMM employs hardware-software co-design to tackle the major inefficiencies in the Baum-Welch algorithm by (1)\&nbsp;designing flexible hardware to accommodate various pHMM designs, (2)\&nbsp;exploiting predictable data dependency patterns through on-chip memory with memoization techniques, (3)\&nbsp;rapidly filtering out unnecessary computations using a hardware-based filter, and (4)\&nbsp;minimizing redundant computations.ApHMM achieves substantial speedups of 15.55×–260.03×, 1.83×–5.34×, and 27.97× when compared to CPU, GPU, and FPGA implementations of the Baum-Welch algorithm, respectively. ApHMM outperforms state-of-the-art CPU implementations in three key bioinformatics applications: (1)\&nbsp;error correction, (2)\&nbsp;protein family search, and (3)\&nbsp;multiple sequence alignment, by 1.29×–59.94×, 1.03×–1.75×, and 1.03×–1.95×, respectively, while improving their energy efficiency by 64.24×–115.46×, 1.75×, and 1.96×.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 h on a single server to 50\% sequence identity, {\textgreater}1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases.},

The resulting granularity of sequence space creates many problems for profile-based sequence comparison programs. In this paper, we suggest several strategies that address these problems, and at the same time speed up the searches for homologous proteins and improve the ability of profile methods to recognize distant homologies. One of our strategies combines database clustering, which removes highly redundant sequence, and a two-step PSI-BLAST (PDB-BLAST), which separates sequence spaces of profile composition and space of homology searching. The combination of these strategies improves distant homology recognitions by more than 100\%, while using only 10\% of the CPU time of the standard PSI-BLAST search. Another method, intermediate profile searches, allows for the exploration of additional search directions that are normally dominated by large protein sub-families within very diverse families. All methods are evaluated with a large fold-recognition benchmark.},

Each COG consists of individual orthologous proteins or orthologous sets of paralogs from at least three lineages. Orthologs typically have the same function, allowing transfer of functional information from one member to an entire COG.

We test Cactus using the Evolver genome evolution simulator, a comprehensive new tool for simulation, and show using these and existing simulations that Cactus significantly outperforms all of its peers.

	abstract = {The main way of analyzing biological sequences is by comparing and aligning them to each other. It remains difficult, however, to compare modern multi-billionbase DNA data sets. The difficulty is caused by the nonuniform (oligo)nucleotide composition of these sequences, rather than their size per se. To solve this problem, we modified the standard seed-and-extend approach (e.g., BLAST) to use adaptive seeds. Adaptive seeds are matches that are chosen based on their rareness, instead of using fixed-length matches. This method guarantees that the number of matches, and thus the running time, increases linearly, instead of quadratically, with sequence length. LAST, our open source implementation of adaptive seeds, enables fast and sensitive comparison of large sequences with arbitrarily nonuniform composition.},

Because of the algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replaceability matrix. This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less than 2 minutes on a minicomputer, and less than 10 minutes on a microcomputer (IBM PC).},

The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

The signal gets blurred in the twilight zone of 20–35\% sequence identity. Here, more than a million sequence alignments were analysed between protein pairs of known structures to re-define a line distinguishing between true and false positives for low levels of similarity. Four results stood out. (i) The transition from the safe zone of sequence alignment into the twilight zone is described by an explosion of false negatives. More than 95\% of all pairs detected in the twilight zone had different structures. More precisely, above a cut-off roughly corresponding to 30\% sequence identity, 90\% of the pairs were homologous; below 25\% less than 10\% were. (ii) Whether or not sequence homology implied structural identity depended crucially on the alignment length. For example, if 10 residues were similar in an alignment of length 16 (\&gt;60\%), structural similarity could not be inferred. (iii) The `more similar than identical' rule (discarding all pairs for which percentage similarity was lower than percentage identity) reduced false positives significantly. (iv) Using intermediate sequences for finding links between more distant families was almost as successful: pairs were predicted to be homologous when the respective sequence families had proteins in common.

By contrast, studies of gene duplications in prokaryotes are scarce and generally limited to a handful of genes or careful analysis of a few prokaryotic lineages. Systematic broad-scale studies of prokaryotic genomes that sample available data are lacking, leaving gaps in our understanding of the contribution of gene duplications as a source of genetic novelty in the prokaryotic world. Here, we report conservative and robust estimates for the frequency of recent gene duplications within prokaryotic genomes relative to recent lateral gene transfer (LGT), as mechanisms to generate multiple copies of related sequences in the same genome. We obtain our estimates by focusing on evolutionarily recent events among 5,655 prokaryotic genomes, thereby avoiding vagaries of deep phylogenetic inference and confounding effects of ancient events and differential loss. We find that recent, genome-specific gene duplications are at least 50 times less frequent and probably 100 times less frequent than recent, genome-specific, gene acquisitions via LGT. The frequency of gene duplications varies across lineages and functional categories. The findings improve our understanding of genome evolution in prokaryotes and have far-reaching implications for evolutionary models that entail LGT to gene duplications ratio as a parameter.},

However, the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) implicated in HGT can copy themselves, so positive selection on MGEs could drive gene duplications. Here, we use a combination of modeling and experimental evolution to examine this hypothesis and use long-read genome sequences of tens of thousands of bacterial isolates to examine its generality in nature. Modeling and experiments show that antibiotic selection can drive the evolution of duplicated antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through MGE transposition. A key implication is that duplicated ARGs should be enriched in environments associated with antibiotic use. To test this, we examined the distribution of duplicated ARGs in 18,938 complete bacterial genomes with ecological metadata. Duplicated ARGs are highly enriched in bacteria isolated from humans and livestock. Duplicated ARGs are further enriched in an independent set of 321 antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. Our findings indicate that duplicated genes often encode functions undergoing positive selection and horizontal gene transfer in microbial communities.},

A PAI called high-pathogenicity island (HPI) and carrying genes involved in iron acquisition (yersiniabactin system) has been previously identified in Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pestis. In this study, the HPI of the third species of Yersinia pathogenic for humans, Y. pseudotuberculosis, has been characterized. We demonstrate that the HPI of strain IP32637 has a physical and genetic map identical to that of Y. pestis. A gene homologous to the bacteriophage P4 integrase gene is located downstream of the asn tRNA locus that borders the HPI of strain IP32637. This int gene is at the same position on the HPI of all three pathogenic Yersinia species. However, in contrast to Y. pestis 6/69, the HPI of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32637 is not invariably adjacent to the pigmentation segment and can be inserted at a distance ≥ 190 kb from this segment. Also, in contrast to Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica, the HPI of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32637 can precisely excise from the chromosome, and, strikingly, it can be found inserted in any of the three asn tRNA loci present on the chromosome of this species, one of which is adjacent to the pigmentation segment. The pigmentation segment, which is present in Y. pestis but not in Y. enterocolitica, is also present and well conserved in all strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis studied. In contrast, the presence and size of the HPIs vary depending on the serotype of the strain: an entire HPI is found in strains of serotypes I only, a HPI with a 9 kb truncation in its left-hand part that carries the IS100 sequence and the psn and ybtE genes characterizes the strains of serotype III, and no HPI is found in strains of serotypes II, IV and V.},

Although the presence of pathogenicity islands is a prerequisite for many bacterial diseases, little is known about their origins or mechanism of transfer into the bacterium. The bacterial agent of epidemic cholera, Vibrio cholerae , contains a bacteriophage known as cholera-toxin phage (CTXφ)4, which encodes the cholera toxin, and a large pathogenicity island called the VPI (for V. cholerae pathogenicity island)5 which itself encodes a toxin-coregulated pilus that functions as a colonization factor6 and as a CTXφ receptor4. We have now identified the VPI pathogenicity island as the genome of another filamentous bacteriophage, VPIφ. We show that VPIφ is transferred between  V. cholerae strains and provide evidence that the TcpA subunit of the toxin-coregulated type IV pilus is in fact a coat protein of VPIφ. Our results are the first description of a phage that encodes a receptor for another phage and of a virus–virus interaction that is necessary for bacterial pathogenicity.},

	abstract = {Genomic islands (GEIs) are characterized by their large size ({\textgreater}10 kb), their frequent association with tRNA-encoding genes and a different G+C content compared with the rest of the chromosome. Many genomic islands are flanked by repeat structures and carry fragments of other mobile and accessory genetic elements, such as bacteriophages, plasmids and insertion sequence (IS) elements.Some GEIs can excise themselves spontaneously from the chromosome and can be transferred to other suitable recipients. GEIs contribute to bacterial genome plasticity and, together with other mobile and accessory genetic elements, to the 'horizontal gene pool' of a given bacterial population.A hypothetical 'life cycle' of GEIs includes the insertion of mobile genetic elements into the bacterial chromosome. Through rearrangements and consecutive insertion and deletion events, the organization and gene content of the original element becomes modified and can lose the features of mobile elements. Owing to the action of bacteriophage integrases that are encoded on genomic islands, these genetic elements can be deleted from the chromosome and, upon transfer into a suitable host, can be chromosomally inserted by site-specific recombination.GEIs contribute to fitness and adaptation. GEIs typically provide a gain-of-function to the host bacterium. As GEIs promote the transfer of multi-gene families, entire phenotypes can be changed in a single-step gene-transfer event.GEIs are expected to have a role in ecological niches where microbial cell numbers and diversity are high and/or in environments that are constantly changing. The GEIs identified so far are relevant in the context of pathogenicity, symbiosis, antibiotic resistance, xenobiotic degradation, and primary and secondary metabolism. It is expected that the functional diversity of GEIs is even greater than is currently known.As GEIs are widely distributed in pathogenic, non-pathogenic and environmental microorganisms, they represent a paradigm rather than a paradox for microbial evolution, underlining the importance of horizontal gene transfer in this process.},

Using gene cloning techniques and pulse field electrophoresis in combination with Southern hybridizations it was demonstrated that the genetic determinants coding for P and ‘P-related’ fimbrial adhesins and hemolysins are closely linked on the chromosomes of different pathogenic E. coli wild-type isolates. For two UTI strains, 536 (06:K15) and J96 (04:K6), a co-deletion of the linked gene clusters coding for hemolysin and fimbriae was observed. The deleted DNA regions which also comprise flanking DNA sequences were termed ‘pathogenicity DNA islands’. Such ‘pathogenicity DNA islands’ were also detected in the genome of 018:K1 isolates of OMP type 6 but were absent on the chromosomes of O18: K1 strains of OMP type 9. A mutant strain, 536-22 was selected from rat kidneys after intraurethral infection of animals with the wild-type parental strain 536. This particular isolate also shows deletions of ‘pathogenicity islands’ leading to a non-pathogenic phenotype. It is therefore concluded that excisions of ‘pathogenicity islands’ from chromosomes of pathogenic E. coli strains are not restricted to the laboratory but also occur in vivo. The generation of deletions may represent a general mechanism of bacterial virulence modulation.},

	abstract = {Numerous prokaryote genomes contain structures known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), composed of 25–50 bp repeats separated by unique sequence spacers of similar length. CRISPR structures are found in the vicinity of four genes named cas1 to cas4. In silico analysis revealed another cluster of three genes associated with CRISPR structures in many bacterial species, named here as cas1B, cas5 and cas6, and also revealed a certain number of spacers that have homology with extant genes, most frequently derived from phages, but also derived from other extrachromosomal elements. Sequence analysis of CRISPR structures from 24 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus vestibularis confirmed the homology of spacers with extrachromosomal elements. Phage sensitivity of S. thermophilus strains appears to be correlated with the number of spacers in the CRISPR locus the strain carries. The authors suggest that the spacer elements are the traces of past invasions by extrachromosomal elements, and hypothesize that they provide the cell immunity against phage infection, and more generally foreign DNA expression, by coding an anti-sense RNA. The presence of gene fragments in CRISPR structures and the nuclease motifs in cas genes of both cluster types suggests that CRISPR formation involves a DNA degradation step.},

	abstract = {Using in silico analysis we studied a novel family of repetitive DNA sequences that is present among both domains of the prokaryotes (Archaea and Bacteria), but absent from eukaryotes or viruses. This family is characterized by direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. To appreciate their characteri-stic structure, we will refer to this family as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). In most species with two or more CRISPR loci, these loci were flanked on one side by a common leader sequence of 300–500 b. The direct repeats and the leader sequences were conserved within a species, but dissimilar between species. The presence of multiple chromosomal CRISPR loci suggests that CRISPRs are mobile elements. Four CRISPR-associated (cas) genes were identified in CRISPR-containing prokaryotes that were absent from CRISPR-negative prokaryotes. The cas genes were invariably located adjacent to a CRISPR locus, indicating that the cas genes and CRISPR loci have a functional relationship. The cas3 gene showed motifs characteristic for helicases of the superfamily 2, and the cas4 gene showed motifs of the RecB family of exonucleases, suggesting that these genes are involved in DNA metabolism or gene expression. The spatial coherence of CRISPR and cas genes may stimulate new research on the genesis and biological role of these repeats and genes.},

This multipartite organization is found in many important organisms, including plant symbionts, such as the nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, and plant, animal, and human pathogens, including the genera Brucella, Vibrio, and Burkholderia. The availability of many complete bacterial genome sequences means that we can now examine on a broad scale the characteristics of the different types of DNA molecules in a genome. Recent work has begun to shed light on the unique properties of each class of replicon, the unique functional role of chromosomal and nonchromosomal DNA molecules, and how the exploitation of novel niches may have driven the evolution of the multipartite genome. The aims of this review are to (i) outline the literature regarding bacterial genomes that are divided into multiple fragments, (ii) provide a meta-analysis of completed bacterial genomes from 1,708 species as a way of reviewing the abundant information present in these genome sequences, and (iii) provide an encompassing model to explain the evolution and function of the multipartite genome structure. This review covers, among other topics, salient genome terminology; mechanisms of multipartite genome formation; the phylogenetic distribution of multipartite genomes; how each part of a genome differs with respect to genomic signatures, genetic variability, and gene functional annotation; how each DNA molecule may interact; as well as the costs and benefits of this genome structure.},

Historically, research has tended to focus on smaller plasmids that are usually easier to isolate, manipulate and sequence, but with improved genome assemblies made possible by long-read sequencing, there is increased appreciation that very large plasmids—known as megaplasmids—are widespread, diverse, complex, and often encode key traits in the biology of their host microorganisms. Why are megaplasmids so big? What other features come with large plasmid size that could affect bacterial ecology and evolution? Are megaplasmids 'just' big plasmids, or do they have distinct characteristics? In this perspective, we reflect on the distribution, diversity, biology, and gene content of megaplasmids, providing an overview to these large, yet often overlooked, mobile genetic elements.

Our results indicate that R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 carries two different circular chromosomes of 3,046 +/- 95 and 914 +/- 17 kilobases (kb). Both chromosome I (3,046 kb) and chromosome II (914 kb) contain rRNA cistrons. It appears that only a single copy of the rRNA genes is contained on chromosome I (rrnA) and that two copies are present on chromosome II (rrnB, rrnC). Additionally, genes for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapB) and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (hemT) are found on chromosome II. In each instance, there appears to be a second copy of each of these genes on chromosome I, but the extent of the DNA homology is very low. Genes giving rise to enzymes involved in CO2 fixation and linked to the gene encoding the form I enzyme (i.e., the form I region) are on chromosome I, whereas those genes representing the form II region are on chromosome II.

	abstract = {The computational prediction of gene function is a key step in making full use of newly sequenced genomes. Function is generally predicted by transferring annotations from homologous genes or proteins for which experimental evidence exists. The ‘ortholog conjecture’ proposes that orthologous genes should be preferred when making such predictions, as they evolve functions more slowly than paralogous genes. Previous research has provided little support for the ortholog conjecture, though the incomplete nature of the data cast doubt on the conclusions.We use experimental annotations from over 40 000 proteins, drawn from over 80 000 publications, to revisit the ortholog conjecture in two pairs of species: (i) Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and (ii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. By making a distinction between questions about the evolution of function versus questions about the prediction of function, we find strong evidence against the ortholog conjecture in the context of function prediction, though questions about the evolution of function remain difficult to address. In both pairs of species, we quantify the amount of information that would be ignored if paralogs are discarded, as well as the resulting loss in prediction accuracy. Taken as a whole, our results support the view that the types of homologs used for function transfer are largely irrelevant to the task of function prediction. Maximizing the amount of data used for this task, regardless of whether it comes from orthologs or paralogs, is most likely to lead to higher prediction accuracy.https://github.com/predragradivojac/oc.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In contrast, engineered phages, when employed as cargo delivery vectors, hold the promise to surmount these limitations and attain enhanced delivery efficacy. This review comprehensively outlines current strategies for the engineering of phages, delineates the principal types of phages utilized as nanocarriers in drug and gene delivery, and explores the application of phage-based delivery systems in disease therapy. Additionally, an incisive analysis is provided, critically examining the challenges confronted by phage-based delivery systems within the domain of nanotechnology.

Discrimination of kin from non-kin has been observed in swarms of the bacterium \textit{Bacillus subtilis}, but the underlying molecular mechanism has been unknown. We used genetic, transcriptomic, and bioinformatic analyses to uncover kin recognition factors in this organism. Our results identified many molecules involved in cell-surface modification and antimicrobial production and response. These genes varied significantly in expression level and mutation phenotype among \textit{B. subtilis} strains, suggesting interstrain variation in the exact kin discrimination mechanism used. Genome analyses revealed a substantial diversity of antimicrobial genes present in unique combinations in different strains, with many likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The dynamic combinatorial effect derived from this plethora of kin discrimination genes creates a tight relatedness cutoff for cooperation that has likely led to rapid diversification within the species. Our data suggest that genes likely originally selected for competitive purposes also generate preferential interactions among kin, thus stabilizing multicellular lifestyles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Competence for natural genetic transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae is controlled by the extracellular concentration of the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), an exported peptide pheromone. Upon entering the competent state, pneumococci start transcribing a number of CSP-responsive genes, termed the early and late competence (com) genes. Some of the proteins encoded by these com genes are absolutely required for DNA uptake and transformation, but most of them are dispensable. This finding indicates that the majority of CSP-regulated proteins in S. pneumoniae is involved in processes unrelated to natural genetic transformation. Recently, however, it became clear that the biological role of a few of the dispensable proteins might be linked to the transformation process. Although these proteins are not needed for transformation per se, they constitute a killing mechanism that could be used by competent cells to acquire DNA from non-competent pneumococci. This mechanism, termed fratricide, has so far only been described for pneumococci. In this manuscript, we review evidence that suggests the conservation of fratricide as well as the independent evolution of its genetic control and of its effectors in several species of the genus Streptococcus, and discuss its possible biological significance in relation to natural transformation.},

	abstract = {DNA segments from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, cloned and propagated in Escherichia coli, were tested for the ability to competitively inhibit gonococcal transformation. The nucleotide sequences of active segments were determined and compared; these sequences contained the sequence 5' GCCGTCTGAA 3' in common. Subcloning studies confirmed the identity of this sequence as the gonococcal DNA recognition site. The three instances of the recognition sequence isolated from N. gonorrhoeae chromosomal DNA contain the sequence in the immediate neighborhood of its inverted repeat. Because a single copy of the sequence functions as a recognition site, the inverted duplication is not required for specific binding. The dyad symmetric arrangements of the chromosomal recognition sequences may form stable stem-loop structures that can function as terminators or attenuators of transcription. These inverted repeats are located at the boundaries of long open reading frames. The recognition sequence also constitutes part of two other probable terminators of gonococcal genes. We conclude that the signal for recognition of transforming DNA by gonococci is a frequent component of transcriptional terminator sequences. This regulatory function might account for the origin and maintenance of recognition sequences in the chromosomes of Gram-negative transformable bacteria.},

Since 1993, fluoroquinolones (i.e., ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or levofloxacin) have been used frequently in the treatment of gonorrhea because of their high efficacy, ready availability, and convenience as a single-dose, oral therapy. However, prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been increasing and is becoming widespread in the United States, necessitating changes in treatment regimens. Beginning in 2000, fluoroquinolones were no longer recommended for gonorrhea treatment in persons who acquired their infections in Asia or the Pacific Islands (including Hawaii); in 2002, this recommendation was extended to California. In 2004, CDC recommended that fluoroquinolones not be used in the United States to treat gonorrhea in men who have sex with men (MSM). This report, based on data from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), summarizes data on fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) in heterosexual males and in MSM throughout the United States. This report also updates CDC's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2006 regarding the treatment of infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae. On the basis of the most recent evidence, CDC no longer recommends the use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of gonococcal infections and associated conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Consequently, only one class of drugs, the cephalosporins, is still recommended and available for the treatment of gonorrhea.},

Neisseria spp. have been shown to preferentially take up and transform their own DNA by recognizing the nonpalindromic 10- or 12-nucleotide sequence 5′- AT GCCGTCTGAA-3′ (additional semiconserved nucleotides are underlined), termed the DNA uptake sequence (DUS10 or DUS12). Here we investigated the effects of the DUS on transformation and DNA uptake for several laboratory strains of N. gonorrhoeae. We found that all strains showed efficient transformation of DUS containing DNA (DUS10 and DUS12) but that the level of transformation with DNA lacking a DUS (DUS0) was variable in different strains. The DUS-enhanced transformation was 20-fold in two strains, FA1090 and FA19, but was approximately 150-fold in strains MS11 and 1291. All strains tested provide some level of DUS0 transformation, and DUS0 transformation was type IV pilus dependent. Competition with plasmid DNA revealed that transformation of MS11 was enhanced by the addition of excess plasmid DNA containing a DUS while FA1090 transformation was competitively inhibited. Although FA1090 was able to mediate much more efficient transformation of DNA lacking a DUS than was MS11, DNA uptake experiments showed similar levels of uptake of DNA containing and lacking a DUS in FA1090 and MS11. Finally, DNA uptake was competitively inhibited in both FA1090 and MS11. Taken together, our data indicate that the role of the DUS during DNA transformation is variable between strains of N. gonorrhoeae and may influence multiple steps during transformation.},

Its variations, in terms of specific mechanisms, may in part reflect responses to different selective pressures in different bacteria. We have suggested that both gene transfer and acquisition of carbon, nitrogen, and energy represent physiological needs that may have contributed to the evolution of natural transformation. While natural transformation was the first mechanism of genetic exchange to be detected, it is perhaps the least understood. Our understanding of the mechanism for uptake and incorporation of soluble DNA has increased significantly in the last two decades, but the overall picture of transformation as a biologically significant function is still unfolding. The mechanism by which DNA is released for transformation, the control of genes involved in DNA release and uptake, the potential for transformation in the natural environment, and the potential of natural transformation as a tool for other microbiological studies are but a few of the important issues that remain.},

It is based on the uptake and integration of exogenous DNA into the recipient genome. This review examines whether induction of competence for genetic transformation is a general response to stress in gram-positive bacteria. It compares data obtained with bacteria chosen for their different lifestyles, the soil-dweller Bacillus subtilis and the major human pathogen S. pneumoniae. The review focuses on the relationship between competence and other global responses in B. subtilis, as well as on recent evidence for competence induction in response to DNA damage or antibiotics and for the ability of S. pneumoniae to use competence as a substitute for SOS. This comparison reveals that the two species use different fitness-enhancing strategies in response to stress conditions. Whereas B. subtilis combines competence and SOS induction, S. pneumoniae relies only on competence to generate genetic diversity through transformation.},

	abstract = {1. In the course of the examination of sputum from cases of lobar pneumonia, observations have been made on the incidence of the chief types of pneumococci. In the district from which the material was obtained, there was an apparent local diminution in the number of cases of lobar pneumonia due to Type II the figures were 326 per cent. of Type II cases in the period 1920–22, and only 74 per cent. in the period 1924–27. The incidence of Type I was approximately the same in the two periods, the percentages being 3O6 and 343.2. Several different serological varieties of pneumococci have been obtained from the sputum of each of several cases of pneumonia examined at various stages of the disease. This has occurred most frequently in cases of pneumonia due to Type I, and in two instances four different types of Group IV were found in addition to the chief types. The recovery of different types is facilitated by the inoculation of the sputum (preserved in the refrigerator), together with protective sera corresponding to the various types in the order of their appearance.3. Two interesting strains of Group IV pneumococci have been obtained from pneumonic sputnm.One was an R strain which produced typical rough colonies, yet preserved its virnlence for mice and its capacity to form soluble substance. This R pneumococcus developed a large capsnle in the mice, which died of a chronic type of septicaemia. A strain producing smooth colonies was obtained from it in the course of a prolonged series of passage experiments.The second strain, which was proved not to be a mixture, agglutinated specifically with the sera of two different types. In the peritoneal cavity of the mouse the specific soluble substance of each type was produced.4. A method of producing the S to R change through ageing of colonies on chocolate blood medium containing horse serum is described. After two to three days' incubation small rough patches appear in the margins of the smooth colonies, and from these pure R strains can be isolated.5. It has been shown that the R change is not equally advanced in the descendants of virulent pneumococci which have been exposed to the action of homologous immune serum. Some R strains form traces of soluble substance in the peritoneal cavity of the mouse; these revert readily to the virulent S form and, in addition, are able to produce active immunity. Others show no evidence of S antigen; spontaneous reveraion takes place with difficulty, if at all, and they are incapable of producing active immunity. The stronger the immune serum used, the more permanent and complete is the change to the R form.6. Restoration of virulence to an attenuated R strain, with recovery of the S form of colony and of the original serological type characters may be obtained by passage through mice. The change from the R to the S form is favoured by the inoculation of the R culture in large doses into the subcutaneous tissues; but the most certain method of procuring reversion is by the inoculation of the R culture, subcutaneously into a mouse, together with a large dose of virulent culture of the same type killed by heat. Incubation of such a mixture in vitro does not induce reversion.7. Reversion of an R strain to its S form may occasionally be brought about by the simultaneous inoculation of virulent culture of another type, especially when this has been heated for only a short period to 60° 0., e.g. R Type II to its S form when inoculated with heated Type I culture.8. Type I antigen appears to be more sensitive to exposure to heat than Type II antigen, since the former loses the power to cause reversion when heated to 80° C., whereas Type II culture remains effective even after steaming at 100°C.9. The antigens of certain Group IV strains appear to be closely related to that of Type II, and are equally resistant to heat. Steamed cultures of these Group IV strains cause the R form derived from Type II to revert to its S form, while they fail to produce reversion of the R form derived from Type I.10. The inoculation into the subcutaneous tissues of mice of an attenuated R strain derived from one type, together with a large dose of virulent culture of another type killed by heating to 60° C., has resulted in the formation of a virulent S pneumococcus of the same type as that of the heated culture.Thp newly formed S strain may remain localised at the seat of inoculation, or it may disseminate and cause fatal septicaemia.The S form of Type I has been produced from the R form of Type II, and the R form of Type I has been transformed into the S form of Type II.The clear mucinous colonies of Type III have been derived both from the R form of Type I and from the R form of Type II, though they appear to be produced more readily from the latter. The newly formed strains of Type III have been of relatively low virulence, and have frequently remained localised at the subcutaneous seat of inoculation.Virulent strains of Types I and TI have been obtained from an R strain of Group IV.11. Heated R cultures injected in large doses, together with small doses of living R culture have never caused transformation of type, and only rarely produced a reversion of the R form of Type II to its virulent S form.12. The results of the experiments on enhancement of virulence and on transformation of type are discussed and their significance in regard to questions of epidemiology is indicated.},

In the gram-negative bacteria, DNA is first pulled toward the outer membrane by retraction of the pilus and then taken up by binding to periplasmic ComEA, acting as a Brownian ratchet to prevent backward diffusion. A similar mechanism probably operates in the gram-positive bacteria as well, but these systems have been less well characterized. Transport, defined as movement of a single strand of transforming DNA to the cytosol, requires the channel protein ComEC. Although less is understood about this process, it may be driven by proton symport. In this review we also describe various phenomena that are coordinated with the expression of competence for transformation, such as fratricide, the kin-discriminatory killing of neighboring cells, and competence-mediated growth arrest.},

We constructed Bacteroides uniformis 0061 derivatives which carry pVAL-1 and various Bacteroides conjugal elements. The Bacteroides conjugal elements tested were six conjugal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) elements (which appear to be chromosomal), i.e., Tcr ERL, Tcr V479, Tcr Emr ERL, Tcr Emr 12256, Tcr Emr DOT, and Tcr Emr CEST, and the conjugal erythromycin resistance (Emr) plasmid pBF4. These Tcr conjugal elements have not been extensively characterized, except for Tcr ERL. All six Tcr elements tested mobilized pVAL-1 at high frequency (10(-3) to 10(-5)) from one Bacteroides strain to another or from a Bacteroides strain to E. coli. Pregrowth of the donors (containing one of the Tcr elements and pVAL-1) in 1 microgram of tetracycline per ml enhanced the transfer of pVAL-1 by 20- to 10,000-fold, depending on which Tcr element was present in the donor. An Ems derivative of pBF4 (pBF4 delta E2) mobilized pVAL-1 from one Bacteroides strain to another at a frequency of 10(-4) but did not mobilize pVAL-1 from a Bacteroides strain to E. coli as efficiently. Thus the Tcr conjugal elements and pBF4 recognize a mobilization region on pB8-51.},

	abstract = {Background Despite the decades-long use of Bacillus atrophaeus var. globigii (BG) as a simulant for biological warfare (BW) agents, knowledge of its genome composition is limited. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate signatures of deliberate adaptation and selection from natural variation is lacking for most bacterial agents. We characterized a lineage of BGwith a long history of use as a simulant for BW operations, focusing on classical bacteriological markers, metabolic profiling and whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). Results Archival strains and two “present day” type strains were compared to simulant strains on different laboratory media. Several of the samples produced multiple colony morphotypes that differed from that of an archival isolate. To trace the microevolutionary history of these isolates, we obtained WGS data for several archival and present-day strains and morphotypes. Bacillus-wide phylogenetic analysis identified B. subtilis as the nearest neighbor to B. atrophaeus. The genome of B. atrophaeus is, on average, 86\% identical to B. subtilis on the nucleotide level. WGS of variants revealed that several strains were mixed but highly related populations and uncovered a progressive accumulation of mutations among the “military” isolates. Metabolic profiling and microscopic examination of bacterial cultures revealed enhanced growth of “military” isolates on lactate-containing media, and showed that the “military” strains exhibited a hypersporulating phenotype. Conclusions Our analysis revealed the genomic and phenotypic signatures of strain adaptation and deliberate selection for traits that were desirable in a simulant organism. Together, these results demonstrate the power of whole-genome and modern systems-level approaches to characterize microbial lineages to develop and validate forensic markers for strain discrimination and reveal signatures of deliberate adaptation.},

Coevolution between bacteria and plasmids shapes the transfer and stability of plasmids across bacteria. Although ICEs outnumber conjugative plasmids, the dynamics of ICE–bacterium coevolution, ICE transfer rates, and fitness costs are as yet largely unexplored. Conjugative plasmids and ICEs are both transferred by type IV secretion systems, but ICEs are typically immune to segregational loss, suggesting that the evolution of ICE–bacterium associations varies from that of plasmid–bacterium associations.

	abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in microbial evolution, allowing microbes to acquire new genes and phenotypes. Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs, a.k.a. conjugative transposons) are modular mobile genetic elements integrated into a host genome and are passively propagated during chromosomal replication and cell division. Induction of ICE gene expression leads to excision, production of the conserved conjugation machinery (a type IV secretion system), and the potential to transfer DNA to appropriate recipients. ICEs typically contain cargo genes that are not usually related to the ICE life cycle and that confer phenotypes to host cells. We summarize the life cycle and discovery of ICEs, some of the regulatory mechanisms, and how the types of cargo have influenced our view of ICEs. We discuss how ICEs can acquire new cargo genes and describe challenges to the field and various perspectives on ICE biology.},

	abstract = {SUMMARYPlasmids are key vectors of horizontal gene transfer and essential genetic engineering tools. They code for genes involved in many aspects of microbial biology, including detoxication, virulence, ecological interactions, and antibiotic resistance. While many studies have decorticated the mechanisms of mobility in model plasmids, the identification and characterization of plasmid mobility from genome data are unexplored. By reviewing the available data and literature, we established a computational protocol to identify and classify conjugation and mobilization genetic modules in 1,730 plasmids. This allowed the accurate classification of proteobacterial conjugative or mobilizable systems in a combination of four mating pair formation and six relaxase families. The available evidence suggests that half of the plasmids are nonmobilizable and that half of the remaining plasmids are conjugative. Some conjugative systems are much more abundant than others and preferably associated with some clades or plasmid sizes. Most very large plasmids are nonmobilizable, with evidence of ongoing domestication into secondary chromosomes. The evolution of conjugation elements shows ancient divergence between mobility systems, with relaxases and type IV coupling proteins (T4CPs) often following separate paths from type IV secretion systems. Phylogenetic patterns of mobility proteins are consistent with the phylogeny of the host prokaryotes, suggesting that plasmid mobility is in general circumscribed within large clades. Our survey suggests the existence of unsuspected new relaxases in archaea and new conjugation systems in cyanobacteria and actinobacteria. Few genes, e.g., T4CPs, relaxases, and VirB4, are at the core of plasmid conjugation, and together with accessory genes, they have evolved into specific systems adapted to specific physiological and ecological contexts.},

	abstract = {Molecular evolutionary rate varies significantly among species and a strict global molecular clock has been rejected across the tree of life. Generation time is one primary life-history trait that influences the molecular evolutionary rate. Theory predicts that organisms with shorter generation times evolve faster because of the accumulation of more DNA replication errors per unit time. Although the generation-time effect has been demonstrated consistently in plants and animals, the evidence of its existence in bacteria is lacking. The bacterial phylum Firmicutes offers an excellent system for testing generation-time effect because some of its members can enter a dormant, nonreproductive endospore state in response to harsh environmental conditions. It follows that spore-forming bacteria would—with their longer generation times—evolve more slowly than their nonspore-forming relatives. It is therefore surprising that a previous study found no generation-time effect in Firmicutes. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach and leveraging on a large number of Firmicutes genomes, we found sporulation significantly reduces the genome-wide spontaneous DNA mutation rate and protein evolutionary rate. Contrary to the previous study, our results provide strong evidence that the evolutionary rates of bacteria, like those of plants and animals, are influenced by generation time.},

	abstract = {Genome structure variation has profound impacts on phenotype in organisms ranging from microbes to humans, yet little is known about how natural selection acts on genome arrangement. Pathogenic bacteria such as Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic and pneumonic plague, often exhibit a high degree of genomic rearrangement. The recent availability of several Yersinia genomes offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the evolution of genome structure and arrangement. We introduce a set of statistical methods to study patterns of rearrangement in circular chromosomes and apply them to the Yersinia. We constructed a multiple alignment of eight Yersinia genomes using Mauve software to identify 78 conserved segments that are internally free from genome rearrangement. Based on the alignment, we applied Bayesian statistical methods to infer the phylogenetic inversion history of Yersinia. The sampling of genome arrangement reconstructions contains seven parsimonious tree topologies, each having different histories of 79 inversions. Topologies with a greater number of inversions also exist, but were sampled less frequently. The inversion phylogenies agree with results suggested by SNP patterns. We then analyzed reconstructed inversion histories to identify patterns of rearrangement. We confirm an over-representation of “symmetric inversions”—inversions with endpoints that are equally distant from the origin of chromosomal replication. Ancestral genome arrangements demonstrate moderate preference for replichore balance in Yersinia. We found that all inversions are shorter than expected under a neutral model, whereas inversions acting within a single replichore are much shorter than expected. We also found evidence for a canonical configuration of the origin and terminus of replication. Finally, breakpoint reuse analysis reveals that inversions with endpoints proximal to the origin of DNA replication are nearly three times more frequent. Our findings represent the first characterization of genome arrangement evolution in a bacterial population evolving outside laboratory conditions. Insight into the process of genomic rearrangement may further the understanding of pathogen population dynamics and selection on the architecture of circular bacterial chromosomes.},

Conventional strategies for characterizing rearrangements in bacterial genomes rely on comparisons of sequenced genomes from related species. However, the spectra of spontaneous rearrangements in supposedly homogenous and clonal bacterial populations are still poorly characterized. Here we used 454 pyrosequencing technology and a ‘split mapping’ computational method to identify unique junction sequences caused by spontaneous genome rearrangements in chemostat cultures of Salmonella enterica Var. Typhimurium LT2. We confirmed 22 unique junction sequences with a junction microhomology more than 10 bp and this led to an estimation of 51 true junction sequences, of which 28, 12 and 11 were likely to be formed by deletion, duplication and inversion events, respectively. All experimentally confirmed rearrangements had short inverted (inversions) or direct (deletions and duplications) homologous repeat sequences at the endpoints. This study demonstrates the feasibility of genome wide characterization of spontaneous genome rearrangements in bacteria and the very high steady-state frequency (20–40\%) of rearrangements in bacterial populations.},

Most of the SVs such as inversions, deletions and translocations have been largely studied in context of genetic diseases in eukaryotes. However, recent studies demonstrate that genome rearrangements can also have profound impact on prokaryotic genomes, leading to altered cell phenotype. In contrast to single-nucleotide variations, SVs provide a much deeper insight into organization of bacterial genomes at a much better resolution. SVs can confer change in gene copy number, creation of new genes, altered gene expression and many other functional consequences. High-throughput technologies have now made it possible to explore SVs at a much refined resolution in bacterial genomes. Through this review, we aim to highlight the importance of the less explored field of SVs in prokaryotic genomes and their impact. We also discuss its potential applicability in the emerging fields of synthetic biology and genome engineering where targeted SVs could serve to create sophisticated and accurate genome editing.Contact:  vinods@igib.inSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We offer an alternative interpretation of the sequencing data of meiotic products, including the number and type of recombination events, to illustrate the potential for mistakes in single-nucleotide polymorphism calling.

	abstract = {Soils contain a tangle of minerals, water, nutrients, gases, plant roots, decaying organic matter, and microorganisms which work together to cycle nutrients and support terrestrial plant growth. Most soil microorganisms live in periodically interconnected communities closely associated with soil aggregates, i.e., small ({\textless}2 mm), strongly bound clusters of minerals and organic carbon that persist through mechanical disruptions and wetting events. Their spatial structure is important for biogeochemical cycling, and we cannot reliably predict soil biological activities and variability by studying bulk soils alone. To fully understand the biogeochemical processes at work in soils, it is necessary to understand the micrometer-scale interactions that occur between soil particles and their microbial inhabitants. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding soil aggregate microbial communities and identify areas of opportunity to study soil ecosystems at a scale relevant to individual cells. We present a framework for understanding aggregate communities as “microbial villages” that are periodically connected through wetting events, allowing for the transfer of genetic material, metabolites, and viruses. We describe both top-down (whole community) and bottom-up (reductionist) strategies for studying these communities. Understanding this requires combining “model system” approaches (e.g., developing mock community artificial aggregates), field observations of natural communities, and broader study of community interactions to include understudied community members, like viruses. Initial studies suggest that aggregate-based approaches are a critical next step for developing a predictive understanding of how geochemical and community interactions govern microbial community structure and nutrient cycling in soil.},

	abstract = {Microbial minimal generation times range from a few minutes to several weeks. They are evolutionarily determined by variables such as environment stability, nutrient availability, and community diversity. Selection for fast growth adaptively imprints genomes, resulting in gene amplification, adapted chromosomal organization, and biased codon usage. We found that these growth-related traits in 214 species of bacteria and archaea are highly correlated, suggesting they all result from growth optimization. While modeling their association with maximal growth rates in view of synthetic biology applications, we observed that codon usage biases are better correlates of growth rates than any other trait, including rRNA copy number. Systematic deviations to our model reveal two distinct evolutionary processes. First, genome organization shows more evolutionary inertia than growth rates. This results in over-representation of growth-related traits in fast degrading genomes. Second, selection for these traits depends on optimal growth temperature: for similar generation times purifying selection is stronger in psychrophiles, intermediate in mesophiles, and lower in thermophiles. Using this information, we created a predictor of maximal growth rate adapted to small genome fragments. We applied it to three metagenomic environmental samples to show that a transiently rich environment, as the human gut, selects for fast-growers, that a toxic environment, as the acid mine biofilm, selects for low growth rates, whereas a diverse environment, like the soil, shows all ranges of growth rates. We also demonstrate that microbial colonizers of babies gut grow faster than stabilized human adults gut communities. In conclusion, we show that one can predict maximal growth rates from sequence data alone, and we propose that such information can be used to facilitate the manipulation of generation times. Our predictor allows inferring growth rates in the vast majority of uncultivable prokaryotes and paves the way to the understanding of community dynamics from metagenomic data.},

However, where this constraint is weak, among genes not expressed at high levels, divergence is also related to the chromosomal location of the gene; it appears that genes furthest away from oriC, the origin of replication, have a mutation rate approximately two times that of genes near oriC.},

	abstract = {Out-of-frame stop codons (OSCs) occur naturally in coding sequences of all organisms, providing a mechanism of early termination of translation in incorrect reading frame so that the metabolic cost associated with frameshift events can be reduced. Given such a functional significance, we expect statistically overrepresented OSCs in coding sequences as a result of a widespread selection. Accordingly, we examined available prokaryotic genomes to look for evidence of this selection. The complete genome sequences of 990 prokaryotes were obtained from NCBI GenBank. We found that low G+C content coding sequences contain significantly more OSCs and G+C content at specific codon positions were the principal determinants of OSC usage bias in the different reading frames. To investigate if there is overrepresentation of OSCs, we modeled the trinucleotide and hexanucleotide biases of the coding sequences using Markov models, and calculated the expected OSC frequencies for each organism using a Monte Carlo approach. More than 93\% of 342 phylogenetically representative prokaryotic genomes contain excess OSCs. Interestingly the degree of OSC overrepresentation correlates positively with G+C content, which may represent a compensatory mechanism for the negative correlation of OSC frequency with G+C content. We extended the analysis using additional compositional bias models and showed that lower-order bias like codon usage and dipeptide bias could not explain the OSC overrepresentation. The degree of OSC overrepresentation was found to correlate negatively with the optimal growth temperature of the organism after correcting for the G+C\% and AT skew of the coding sequence. The present study uses approaches with statistical rigor to show that OSC overrepresentation is a widespread phenomenon among prokaryotes. Our results support the hypothesis that OSCs carry functional significance and have been selected in the course of genome evolution to act against unintended frameshift occurrences. Some results also hint that OSC overrepresentation being a compensatory mechanism to make up for the decrease in OSCs in high G+C organisms, thus revealing the interplay between two different determinants of OSC frequency.},

No prototrophs ever appear from mixed nonprotoplasted bacteria, or from the auxotrophic parental protoplasts plated separately. The frequency of prototroph formation, which is appreciable only when the mixed protoplasts are exposed to polyethylene glycol treatment, may exceed 1 X 10(-4) of the total protoplast population initially present, which is 1 to 4 X 10(-3) of those protoplasts which reverted to the bacillary form. It is strongly dependent on the number and chromosomal location of the markers used in the selection of the prototrophs, and it is unaffected when either one of the parental strains bears the phage phi105 in the inducible prophage state. No auxotrophic bacteria, parental or otherwise, were found as segregants from repeatedly isolated protrotrophic clones growing in a nonselective medium. Unselected markers segregate among the selected recombinants. It is concluded that the observed formation of prototropic bacteria is due to protoplast fusion, a process which does not induce prophage development, and that the only stable products of the resulting diploid state are haploid recombinants.},

More than 20 different versions of endosymbiotic theory have been presented in the literature to explain the origin of eukaryotes and their mitochondria. Very few of those models account for eukaryotic anaerobes. The role of energy and the energetic constraints that prokaryotic cell organization placed on evolutionary innovation in cell history has recently come to bear on endosymbiotic theory. Only cells that possessed mitochondria had the bioenergetic means to attain eukaryotic cell complexity, which is why there are no true intermediates in the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. Current versions of endosymbiotic theory have it that the host was an archaeon (an archaebacterium), not a eukaryote. Hence the evolutionary history and biology of archaea increasingly comes to bear on eukaryotic origins, more than ever before. Here, we have compiled a survey of endosymbiotic theories for the origin of eukaryotes and mitochondria, and for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus, summarizing the essentials of each and contrasting some of their predictions to the observations. A new aspect of endosymbiosis in eukaryote evolution comes into focus from these considerations: the host for the origin of plastids was a facultative anaerobe.},

H-NS contains at least two independent structural domains: a C-terminal domain, involved in the DNA-protein interactions, and a N-terminal domain, likely involved in protein–protein interactions. Recent reports have revealed that H-NS is a key factor in a multi-component gene regulatory system. Factors have now been discovered which can backup or antagonise H-NS action at certain promoters.

IHF is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that bends the DNA by over 160°. HU is the most conserved NAP, which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. Despite their importance, the in vivo interactions of the two proteins to the DNA remain to be described at a high resolution and on a genome-wide scale. Further, the effects of these proteins on gene expression on a global scale remain contentious. Finally, the contrast between the functions of the homo- and heterodimeric forms of proteins deserves the attention of further study. Here we present a genome-scale study of HU- and IHF binding to the Escherichia coli K12 chromosome using ChIP-seq. We also perform microarray analysis of gene expression in single- and double-deletion mutants of each protein to identify their regulons. The sequence-specific binding profile of IHF encompasses ∼30\% of all operons, though the expression of \&lt;10\% of these is affected by its deletion suggesting combinatorial control or a molecular backup. The binding profile for HU is reflective of relatively non-specific binding to the chromosome, however, with a preference for A/T-rich DNA. The HU regulon comprises highly conserved genes including those that are essential and possibly supercoiling sensitive. Finally, by performing ChIP-seq experiments, where possible, of each subunit of IHF and HU in the absence of the other subunit, we define genome-wide maps of DNA binding of the proteins in their hetero- and homodimeric forms.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic DNA methylation in bacteria has been traditionally studied in the context of antiparasitic defense and as part of the innate immune discrimination between self and nonself DNA. However, sequencing advances that allow genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation at the single-base resolution are nowadays expanding and have propelled a modern epigenomic revolution in our understanding of the extent, evolution, and physiological relevance of methylation. Indeed, as the number of mapped bacterial methylomes recently surpassed 4,000, increasing evidence supports roles for methylation in gene expression regulation, virulence, and host colonization, among others. In this paper, I summarize lessons taken from high-dimensional methylome data analyses and recent efforts that we and others are developing to leverage such findings into meaningful biological insights and overarching frameworks. Ultimately, I highlight anticipated research avenues and technological developments likely to unfold in the coming years.},

	abstract = {To obtain a higher resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of species within a genus or genera within a family, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) is currently a widely used method. In MLSA studies, partial sequences of genes coding for proteins with conserved functions (‘housekeeping genes’) are used to generate phylogenetic trees and subsequently deduce phylogenies. However, MLSA is not only suggested as a phylogenetic tool to support and clarify the resolution of bacterial species with a higher resolution, as in 16S rRNA gene-based studies, but has also been discussed as a replacement for DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) in species delineation. Nevertheless, despite the fact that MLSA has become an accepted and widely used method in prokaryotic taxonomy, no common generally accepted recommendations have been devised to date for either the whole area of microbial taxonomy or for taxa-specific applications of individual MLSA schemes. The different ways MLSA is performed can vary greatly for the selection of genes, their number, and the calculation method used when comparing the sequences obtained. Here, we provide an overview of the historical development of MLSA and critically review its current application in prokaryotic taxonomy by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the method's numerous variations. This provides a perspective for its future use in forthcoming genome-based genotypic taxonomic analyses.},

E. coli traditionally is thought to live within the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other warm-blooded animals and not to survive for extended periods outside its host; this understanding is the basis for its widespread use as a fecal contamination indicator. Here, we report the genome sequences of nine environmentally adapted strains that are phenotypically and taxonomically indistinguishable from typical E. coli (commensal or pathogenic). We find, however, that the commensal genomes encode for more functions that are important for fitness in the human gut, do not exchange genetic material with their environmental counterparts, and hence do not evolve according to the recently proposed fragmented speciation model. These findings are consistent with a more stringent and ecologic definition for bacterial species than the current definition and provide means to start replacing traditional approaches of defining distinctive phenotypes for new species with omics-based procedures. They also have important implications for reliable diagnosis and regulation of pathogenic E. coli and for the coliform cell-counting test.},

	abstract = {Abstract Whether prokaryotes, and other microorganisms, form distinct clusters that can be recognized as species remains an issue of paramount theoretical as well as practical consequence in identifying, regulating, and communicating about these organisms. In the past decade, comparisons of thousands of genomes of isolates and hundreds of metagenomes have shown that prokaryotic diversity may be predominantly organized in such sequence-discrete clusters, albeit organisms of intermediate relatedness between the identified clusters are also frequently found. Accumulating evidence suggests, however, that the latter ?intermediate? organisms show enough ecological and/or functional distinctiveness to be considered different species. Notably, the area of discontinuity between clusters often?but not always?appears to be around 85\%?95\% genome-average nucleotide identity, consistently among different taxa. More recent studies have revealed remarkably similar diversity patterns for viruses and microbial eukaryotes as well. This high consistency across taxa implies a specific mechanistic process that underlies the maintenance of the clusters. The underlying mechanism may be a substantial reduction in the efficiency of homologous recombination, which mediates (successful) horizontal gene transfer, around 95\% nucleotide identity. Deviations from the 95\% threshold (e.g., species showing lower intraspecies diversity) may be caused by ecological differentiation that imposes barriers to otherwise frequent gene transfer. While this hypothesis that clusters are driven by ecological differentiation coupled to recombination frequency (i.e., higher recombination within vs. between groups) is appealing, the supporting evidence remains anecdotal. The data needed to rigorously test the hypothesis toward advancing the species concept are also outlined.},

Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) help address this question by facilitating high resolution taxonomic analysis of thousands of genomes from diverse phylogenetic lineages. To scale to available genomes and beyond, we present FastANI, a new method to estimate ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. FastANI is accurate for both finished and draft genomes, and is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to alignment-based approaches. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal clear genetic discontinuity, with 99.8\% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed conforming to {\textgreater}95\% intra-species and {\textless}83\% inter-species ANI values. This discontinuity is manifested with or without the most frequently sequenced species, and is robust to historic additions in the genome databases.},

	abstract = {DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) values have been used by bacterial taxonomists since the 1960s to determine relatedness between strains and are still the most important criterion in the delineation of bacterial species. Since the extent of hybridization between a pair of strains is ultimately governed by their respective genomic sequences, we examined the quantitative relationship between DDH values and genome sequence-derived parameters, such as the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of common genes and the percentage of conserved DNA. A total of 124 DDH values were determined for 28 strains for which genome sequences were available. The strains belong to six important and diverse groups of bacteria for which the intra-group 16S rRNA gene sequence identity was greater than 94 \%. The results revealed a close relationship between DDH values and ANI and between DNA–DNA hybridization and the percentage of conserved DNA for each pair of strains. The recommended cut-off point of 70 \% DDH for species delineation corresponded to 95 \% ANI and 69 \% conserved DNA. When the analysis was restricted to the protein-coding portion of the genome, 70 \% DDH corresponded to 85 \% conserved genes for a pair of strains. These results reveal extensive gene diversity within the current concept of ‘species’. Examination of reciprocal values indicated that the level of experimental error associated with the DDH method is too high to reveal the subtle differences in genome size among the strains sampled. It is concluded that ANI can accurately replace DDH values for strains for which genome sequences are available.},

We found the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the shared genes between two strains to be a robust means to compare genetic relatedness among strains, and that ANI values of approximately 94\% corresponded to the traditional 70\% DNA-DNA reassociation standard of the current species definition. At the 94\% ANI cutoff, current species includes only moderately homogeneous strains, e.g., most of the {\textgreater}4-Mb genomes share only 65-90\% of their genes, apparently as a result of the strains having evolved in different ecological settings. Furthermore, diagnostic genetic signatures (boundaries) are evident between groups of strains of the same species, and the intergroup genetic similarity can be as high as 98-99\% ANI, indicating that justifiable species might be found even among organisms that are nearly identical at the nucleotide level. Notably, a large fraction, e.g., up to 65\%, of the differences in gene content within species is associated with bacteriophage and transposase elements, revealing an important role of these elements during bacterial speciation. Our findings are consistent with a definition for species that would include a more homogeneous set of strains than provided by the current definition and one that considers the ecology of the strains in addition to their evolutionary distance.},

	abstract = {The late 19th century was the beginning of bacterial taxonomy and bacteria were classified on the basis of phenotypic markers. The distinction of prokaryotes and eukaryotes was introduced in the 1960s. Numerical taxonomy improved phenotypic identification but provided little information on the phylogenetic relationships of prokaryotes. Later on, chemotaxonomic and genotypic methods were widely used for a more satisfactory classification. Archaea were first classified as a separate group of prokaryotes in 1977. The current classification of Bacteria and Archaea is based on an operational-based model, the so-called polyphasic approach, comprised of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic data, as well as phylogenetic information. The provisional status Candidatus has been established for describing uncultured prokaryotic cells for which their phylogenetic relationship has been determined and their authenticity revealed by in situ probing. The ultimate goal is to achieve a theory-based classification system based on a phylogenetic/evolutionary concept. However, there are currently two contradictory opinions about the future classification of Bacteria and Archaea. A group of mostly molecular biologists posits that the yet-unclear effect of gene flow, in particular lateral gene transfer, makes the line of descent difficult, if not impossible, to describe. However, even in the face of genomic fluidity it seems that the typical geno- and phenotypic characteristics of a taxon are still maintained, and are sufficient for reliable classification and identification of Bacteria and Archaea. There are many well-defined genotypic clusters that are congruent with known species delineated by polyphasic approaches. Comparative sequence analysis of certain core genes, including rRNA genes, may be useful for the characterization of higher taxa, whereas various character genes may be suitable as phylogenetic markers for the delineation of lower taxa. Nevertheless, there may still be a few organisms which escape a reliable classification.},

Huge efforts are made to assemble such a large tree, helped by the decrease of sequencing costs and improved methods to reconstruct and combine phylogenies, but no tool exists today to explore the ToL in its entirety in a satisfying manner. By combining methods used in modern cartography, such as OpenStreetMap, with a new way of representing tree-like structures, I created Lifemap, a tool allowing the exploration of a complete representation of the ToL (between 800,000 and 2.2 million species depending on the data source) in a zoomable interface. A server version of Lifemap also allows users to visualize their own trees. This should help researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology in their everyday work, but may also permit the diffusion to a broader audience of our current knowledge of the evolutionary relationships linking all organisms.},

	abstract = {This revision of the classification of eukaryotes follows that of Adl et al., 2012 [J. Euk. Microbiol. 59(5)] and retains an emphasis on protists. Changes since have improved the resolution of many nodes in phylogenetic analyses. For some clades even families are being clearly resolved. As we had predicted, environmental sampling in the intervening years has massively increased the genetic information at hand. Consequently, we have discovered novel clades, exciting new genera and uncovered a massive species level diversity beyond the morphological species descriptions. Several clades known from environmental samples only have now found their home. Sampling soils, deeper marine waters and the deep sea will continue to fill us with surprises. The main changes in this revision are the confirmation that eukaryotes form at least two domains, the loss of monophyly in the Excavata, robust support for the Haptista and Cryptista. We provide suggested primer sets for DNA sequences from environmental samples that are effective for each clade. We have provided a guide to trophic functional guilds in an appendix, to facilitate the interpretation of environmental samples, and a standardized taxonomic guide for East Asian users.},

	abstract = {The polyphasic approach used today in the taxonomy and systematics of the Bacteria and Archaea includes the use of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic data. The use of 16S rRNA gene sequence data has revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world and led to a rapid increase in the number of descriptions of novel taxa, especially at the species level. It has allowed in many cases for the demarcation of taxa into distinct species, but its limitations in a number of groups have resulted in the continued use of DNA–DNA hybridization. As technology has improved, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided a rapid and cost-effective approach to obtaining whole-genome sequences of microbial strains. Although some 12 000 bacterial or archaeal genome sequences are available for comparison, only 1725 of these are of actual type strains, limiting the use of genomic data in comparative taxonomic studies when there are nearly 11 000 type strains. Efforts to obtain complete genome sequences of all type strains are critical to the future of microbial systematics. The incorporation of genomics into the taxonomy and systematics of the Bacteria and Archaea coupled with computational advances will boost the credibility of taxonomy in the genomic era. This special issue of International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology contains both original research and review articles covering the use of genomic sequence data in microbial taxonomy and systematics. It includes contributions on specific taxa as well as outlines of approaches for incorporating genomics into new strain isolation to new taxon description workflows.},
